# 126. A Trial Organized By The Police At The Police College

During one ordinary weekday evening, as I sat at home among my family listen to the radio, the doorbell rang violently. My wife went to open. A patrol of three uniformed police officers pushed through the door, asking strictly whether I was Ossi Törrönen. When I admitted this was the case, they ordered me to wear the jacket and put the hat on, and they dragged me down the C-stairs. To my inquiries about the matter, they just snapped that I know what this is all about. They also told me that now it is over, and the day of judgment has come. I found a black police van ("Maija") waiting for us when we got to Village road. There were already all the Castle Wards closely guarded and completely puzzled. With sirens howling, we drove the police van to the back door of the Police College. We were transported by side stairs to the second floor and to a larger room where many police officers in uniform sat at the tables and on the side benches. One side wall was a cloth curtain. When it came in slowly sliding aside, we found ourselves standing on the Police College ballroom stage, and the hall itself was crowded with people. I saw the highest police chief of our country in the front seat, Chief of Police Fjalar Jarva, and his entourage. The college's rector, almost the entire faculty, and the rest of the hall were filled with students. And now began at the court session stage, which followed down to the smallest details the actual courts and did not tolerate any play. The court's chairman was Knut Aas, the public prosecutor was Kauko Katila, and senior police students as jurors, including those two female police students. In an unusually long and detailed indictment, we were charged with a wide variety of crimes. Despite my numerous demands, I never obtained the minutes of that trial; I will list them below those accusations that remained in my mind. There were dozens of other charges, too.

```
Deprivation of liberty. (Catching a mallard in Töölönlahti).
Assault. (Capturing Police Counselor Eloranta in front of the Police College).
Gross violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. (Teekkaris climbed on the college's roof without a safety rope).
Unauthorization possession of the jumping board (from the college gym).
Secret radio transmission (in the Atomic Cave in the performance of its robot).
Smuggling and violation of the Alcohol Act (During Dipoli felling voluntary work, the home-brew served at that time in Servin Mökki as if contained more than 4% of alcohol).
Numerous violations of public order (including, for example, pipe shouts in Otaniemi).

At first, the castle wards tried to laugh off. However, after the chairman hit the table with a mallet a few times, warning of the trial's disruption, and the police guards stepped closer to the accused with the batons in their hands, the boys fell silent. The session lasted two hours with all its formalities, and no matter how we proved our innocence, the judgment was short and harsh. -The accused have been found guilty of all the crimes alleged. All of them are convicted of being permanently disposed of with fire. The judgment was not subject to appeal and was ordered to be enforced immediately. In goose march, we went to the ground floor sauna and quite comfortably spent the rest of the evening. At least we convicts stated that in these cases, crimes being worth it."
