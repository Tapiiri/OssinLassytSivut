# 144. The Original Operating Idea Of The Pinecone Statue

Simultaneously with the construction of DIPOLI, there an idea group led by then teekkari Reijo Perko. The idea group intensively designed some kind of decorative statue to so-called "TEEKKARI SQUARE," which was the working title for the forecourt of Dipoli. GROUP-PERKO finally ended up to a pinecone-like mobile device, which original operating idea is now worth putting on paper - so fantastic it was.

1. The special metal pushrods that open the "leaves" of the cone are heated with numerous small gas flames. Rods are made of material in which the thermal expansion is as large as possible.
2. The heated rods expand and open the leaves of the cone.
3. When the leaves have opened, the gas flames are reduced to the minimum, after which -
4. Coldwater jets target the rods, reducing those to the minimum length, and pull the leaves to the closing position.
5. From the closed cone, people can hear for a moment "teekkari melodies." After a short break, the stages from 1 to 5 are repeated, et cetera.

As one could expect, the Board of TKY rejected this original idea as "too prone to interferences and too expensive." Hence, the group Perko implemented their Pinecone as a stripped-down model. The opening and closing *occurred primitively only with the aid of an unsympathetic electric motor*.

I underlined the word "happened" because, to my resentment, the CONE has gone out completely. There, it stands still motionlessly. During my time, it had a coin machine that made Pinecone operate with one Finnish Mark coin. The revenues went for some scholarship funds if I remember right. Put the Pinecone again in good condition, dammit, and increase the number of coins significantly. Then, at least during the summertime, tourists and congress guests would gladly pour money into it."
