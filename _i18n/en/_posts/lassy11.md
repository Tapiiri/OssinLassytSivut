# 11. Eel

Once, during one summer morning, I went early to the Otaniemi sports field to run. While I was jogging along the outer coal crushing track, I got a competitor next to me, one that is probably rarely seen on sports fields. The eel, almost one meter long and wrist-thick, doing the same as what I was doing. An explanation was then found for this mystery as well. Janitor Määttänen had the aforementioned beast  on its long line and left it in a ditch that orbited the runway for a moment. The ditch had then only a little water. Then, however, there were heavy thunderstorms, the ditch was filled, and water also rose on the tracks. Mister eel was then on its way to freedom until Määttänen came, knocked his prey, and took it to his apartment's bathtub. Then we went as a group to marvel at the handsome animal."
