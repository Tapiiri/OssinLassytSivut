# 24. Pentti Kerola And Rubber Rope Sling

One of the "sports" of Nurse Competitions is worth mentioning, which nearly had regrettable consequences. Luckily, that was avoided. The working name was "catapult sled." We borrowed 800-strand rubber ropes from Jämijärvi Aviation School, with which once gliders and sailplanes were thrown into the air from the top of a ridge. We made out of plywood such a large and low sled that a sledder could sit on it by holding on to the two rope loops attached to the sled's front end. At the front end was yet a sturdy towing hook, to which the rubber rope could be attached so that it came off the sled "idiot-proof" after jerking. The sled was dragged to the springlike, snow-free, and rough ice of Laajalahti.

At first, everything went well. Three teekkaris pulled from each branch of the V-angled rubber rope. The one who was to be slung in the sled shook from waiting and probably from something else, too. Two or three teekkaris sat behind the sled on ice, and their feet were in holes that were done by chopping the ice. This was done to prevent the sled from leaving prematurely. When the rubber rope branches were stretched to the extreme by running, and the teekkaris, who sat behind the sled, let the sled go, the sled plunged at a sloping acceleration along the ice. In turns, we hurled nurse students, sea cadets, and teekkaris for general joy. I ordered a couple more teekkaris to rubber rope stretching for the last match to get more excitement for the final hot round.

Teekkari Pentti Kerola sat on the sled, the rope was stretched to the extreme - a swish was heard - and the sled plunged along the ice. However, the acceleration had now increased from the power of additional stretchers. It had risen to such an extent that Pena flew from behind around and off the sled. The accident happened because he had placed the aforementioned holding ropes around his wrists like ski poles' loops. Thus, he did not detach from the sled but dragged tens of meters along the rough hard ice. Fortunately, each competitor was required to wear a motorcyclist's helmet. It saved Pena. However, we had to take him in shock and head bleeding to Maria's Hospital\*. It was there where he regained his consciousness.

After noticing me next to his bed, Pena immediately asked: "Shouldn't today there have been a nurse party at Servi today?". When I admitted that this was the case, Pena said immediately: "In that case, why are you sitting there? Get to Servi and immediately". I obeyed the order with an eased mind and told the depressed, awaiting competition crowd Pena's greeting. Gradually the mood rose to "normal." However, Kerola had to spend a couple of days in the hospital. When he returned home, the first thing he did was to come to thank me. He said that "with this ice shaker, I had decisively enhanced his studying by shaking out a considerable amount of useless assumptions and thoughts from his skull."
