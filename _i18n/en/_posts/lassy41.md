# 41. Onni Vaara And The Canadian Maple

To the history of glorious old Poli is inextricably linked janitor Onni Vaara. All those teekkaris who studied in 1930-1960 remember him very well. For three decades, he served there "under the dark roofs of Poli," the polytechnicians with tenacious diligence, skill, and above all with patience. He, if anyone, could have told countless true stories of the "good old days'" teekkari activities. But he is no longer telling these stories. After working for a few more years in Teekkari Village, he got into a well-deserved retirement. He had time to observe from his Retuperä apartment "the Latter-day events" before his death. Let the following true story witness Olli Vaara's "teekkarization" during his long service time.

When the previously mentioned teekkari delegation from the University of Toronto visited Otaniemi, they planted at the time of departure their national tree, maple, in front of TKY 3 as a reminder of their visit. For some reason, that original tree began to wither and turn yellow. I happened to lament of that matter also to Onni Vaara. And how come. One morning I found to my surprise, that the maple was beautiful and green again. "Heard from the matter," Onni Vaara told me in his peaceful manner that he changed the poor-condition maple to a new one at night. He did it so fast that no one had time to notice it. And this maple, planted by old man Vaara, was a good one by its quality because at least in the autumn of -81, it grew as magnificent and bushy in place. I'd like to call this tree "Onni Vaara's Canadian Maple." I can only imagine how big and awesome it will be at Teekkari Village's 100th-anniversary celebrations on 13.5.2052."
