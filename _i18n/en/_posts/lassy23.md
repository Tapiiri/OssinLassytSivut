# 23. Nurses' Gifts. Different Types Of Competition

Those who visited Servin Mökki while it was still a restaurant probably remember those Nurse College students' gifts hanging in the ceiling. Among these gifts was also a 5-liter pharmacy bottle. This bottle hung there on the wall showing the "woman's inherent treachery." After that year's battles of the "nurse competition" had been fought, and the pain sisters had with some secret aids won, the traditional evening celebration was held in the cottage. The winners brought the bottle mentioned above with them. Their donation speech noted that the bottle contained high-quality "pharmacy cognac, " prescribed by doctors for certain heart diseases.

When the nurse students' bus left, taking them all to Helsinki, almost every teekkari in the building noted around his heart phenomena, which required rapid medication. Well. The bottle was opened, and soon 5 liters disappeared (it was really colorwise and smellwise right stuff) in the throats of heart-sick teekkaris. But for the rest of the night, those heart-sick teekkaris ran at record speeds along runways. At one end of the runway was the bed, and at the other was the toilet bowl. The nurse students, in all their treachery, had salted that "Jallu" with some laxative. Its effect was indeed excellent. Recoilless like anti-tank weapons sat those teekkaris, who had participated in that event, on top of Arabia's faiences waiting for a better time.

For the actual matches of nurses, we strived to develop new, unprecedented sport types. One was called in German "Hinterhalbsturzkampf." All that was needed in this sport was an ice hill and the first two parts of that German. Once, we made a motorized ice carousel by dragging a vast long spruce trunk onto the ice and axing it to the ice through a vertical axis, pushed into the mud. The axis was by no means in the middle of this horizontal tree. Still, the longer part probably has been 20 meters long and the shorter only two meters long. On the shorter side, the village's Ferguson tractor and ordinary children's sled to the longer side. You can only imagine at what speed the sled spun its track as Ferguson pressed on its own track at full speed. The excitement was only in how long each participant stayed on the sled. Everyone flew from it; the time, style, and the flying direction varied.

Once, we performed undoubtedly the first Tandem ski competitions in the world by nailing old skis every five pieces in a row. With these, the match was performed in teams of 5 men and 5 women. Observation: It is rather impossible to get five people to ski at the same pace. Once there was a water throwing competition between teekkaris and nurse students. Even that one was lost by teekkaris despite the superiority of natural competition equipment. The match's technique was that the sisters tossed water-filled balloons from the upper balcony of TKY 3 to teekkaris, who were waiting below, ready to catch those balloons. No balloons were caught, no matter how much the boys tried. An entry was entered in the match report that only the teekkaris left soaked."
