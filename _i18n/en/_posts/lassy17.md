# 17. A Driller Passes Out To Our Rantasauna

An outsider also caused another mess. One night an unknown man had drifted into the TKY5 building and had begun to wake up the residents in the middle of the night by ringing the doorbells. The residents, for understandable reasons, always repelled the intruder. Due to this, the intruder was also enraged. He broke several windows at the lower lobby on his way out, disappearing into the winter frostbite night. Under the emotion of pity started that building's castle warden a nocturnal search on the winter headland. There was a reason to fear that the mand would even freeze to death as he was on the verge of passing out. When the search crew then arrived at the sauna beach, the sight was depressing. Every window in the sauna building - including the fireplace room's large view window - was broken. A long rope led out of the fireplace room's window. As we followed the rope, it led first to the fireplace room, then to the hallway, and finally to the restroom, the door of which was almost closed. When we opened the door, there sat our hero with the lifebuoy on his neck. Well. The man was taken to lock-up, covers to broken windows, and later a claim to the district court. From this man, we never received the compensation - what a vermin for a man."
