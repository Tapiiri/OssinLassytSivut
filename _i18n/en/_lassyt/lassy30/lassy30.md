After the Teekkari Village turned 5 years on May 13, a significant celebration event was organized at Servin Mökki. The leading performer of the prestigious invitation guest audience was naturally forever teekkari, professor Bernhard Wuolle. I had given a task to maintenance man Martti Turunen. His mission was to construct an electrically ignited 5th anniversary bang with five consecutive blows, each more robust than the previous blow. Turunen really did the work "as instructed."

When the climax of the celebration began, the forever teekkari pressed the button hanging from the ceiling. From the forest in front of Servin Mökki's French door, a handsome bang was heard. After 5 seconds, there was another bang, at which point the windows started already to shake. Again it took 5 seconds, and the whole building began to sway as the dust began to come off the ceiling. After the fourth mighty bomb exploded, the festive audience instinctively moved to the black back wall from the windows. When the actual 5th anniversary bang rushed like a mighty thunder into the air, the audience was partially glued along the back wall. When the cottage did not collapse, the result was vigorous applause for a successful blow. Later, Turunen explained that he had made, according to my order, every bang stronger than the previous one. His solution was 1-2-4-8-16. The numbers refer to the number of dynamite sticks unsecured and immersed in the field approximately at the current Construction Department.\*
