# 34. RWBK's Fire Alarm And Other Hot Events

Someone has said at one point that "teekkari bustle without Retuperä's trumpeting marching band would be like fire without smoke or smoke without fire." And yes, I guess I must agree with this aphorism. Probably there haven't been many teekkari events that haven't succeeded without RWBK. When the world's first and only Servin Mökki once opened its doors, Retuperä often marked the cottage's events with their euphonies. They then donated to Servin Mökki a really reliable and efficient fire alarm device on one of their visits. They nailed an ordinary cardboard shoebox to the inner wall. A wine glass with a foot was attached to the box with a package cord and a coat's large button. The third thing was the enamel instructions of the Helsinki Fire Department that were used in fire clocks. "TULIPALON SATTUESSA LÄHEISYYDESSÄ 1. SÄRJE LASI, 2 PAINA
NAPPIA ja odota sen jälkeen palokunnan saapumista. VID ELDSVADA I NÄRHETEN 1. SÖNDRA
GLASET 2. TRYCK PÅ KNAPPEN och inviinta brandkårens ankomst."\* It was probably thanks to this powerful device that the cottage did not ignite in flames due to hot events.

Outside of the actual Village lit up twice, according to my memory. The other was a classic incident; teekkari X lits their North State cigarette, went to his bed horizontally and contemplated. This profound contemplation was then interrupted by a continuous shouting when that same teekkari noticed the blanket on fire. After hearing such a roar, the other dormitory residents rushed into our hero's room. They carried the roaring teekkari and the bed to the dormitory's shower room. The insurance company was sympathetic to this situation. Another fire that I remember did not get any sympathy from the prestigious lensmann of Espoo. It happened so that teekkari Y turned on the electric coffee machine on top of the bookshelf. Teekkari Y then went to Servi to buy tobacco. In the cozy atmosphere of Servi, the whole coffee making was forgotten when Y ended up having more extended conversations than what Y originally planned to. The question regarding coffee making came back to Y's mind when the firetrucks of the Fire College rushed on the scene with sirens howling. After the water had boiled dry, the bookshelf caught fire, smoking the whole room and then the dormitory. The insurance company did understand this accident, too. However, the lensmann of Espoo sued that teekkari to the District Court for carelessness. The fines arrived rapidly, and that teekkari got unique memories from Otaniemi.

\*Translator's remark: The official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. The instructions are in English: "IN CASE OF FIRE TAKING PLACE NEARBY 1. BREAK THE GLASS, 2. PRESS THE BUTTON and wait for the arrival of the fire department.""
