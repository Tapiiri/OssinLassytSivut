To stay at Rantasauna, I remember how from the THS\* of Stockholm came a 204 centimeters long teekkari representative as an anniversary guest. In addition to this overall length, he had extraordinarily long limbs. Even his hands hung like with a gibbon below the knees. The annual ball ended in the early hours to the traditional Rantasauna continuation session with that guest who was with us. During this event, it was found out that this tall and lanky viking was unaccustomed to Finnish sauna rituals. He formed an obsessed mindset that the Finnish Mongols will shed him in the sauna, either File á la Oscar or something else. He always grabbed onto something with these long forelimbs as we tried to calm him down and get out. We even got him out of the building several times, but he always got out and rushed back to the sauna. After half an hour's unnecessary fuss, we held a consultative meeting and decided to change our tactics. We brought his own bed from the TKY 5 building and a long rope from the garage. We took these items into the sauna and then put that Swede to the bed and packed him neatly to it with a rope. Accompanied by a song suitable for the event, we carried him to his room without any significant troubles. He did not remember anything about the incident in the morning. Still, He was very grateful that his 204-centimeter body was fine and parts in place in every respect.
