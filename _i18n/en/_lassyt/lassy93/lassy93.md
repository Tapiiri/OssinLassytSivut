I once attended the Chalmers' annual ball in Gothenburg along with the TKY's delegation. Our group was led by the TKY's board's chairman of that time, teekkari Pekka Tarjanne.

Well. The annual ball was teekkarifully distinguished, but all the more fun. There was a sufficient amount of program and foodâ€”even drinks. In Chalmers' bear set's men's room, there was an oil painting on the wall, and its size was about 75 x 50 cm. It wasn't Rubens or neither Leonardo, but it was a "real work of art" nevertheless, with its relevant signatures. How come the mentioned work of art somehow grabbed one of our representatives' sleeve, and it was carried out of the house under the gaberdine. It was rushed onward to the Gothenburg Art Museum, where an amanuensis received it with voice trembled due to gratitude. Then, when the annual ball's closing dinner program was at the roast, Pekka stood up to speak and poured out with resplendent words hum of gratitude over the hosts. Finally, he asked the hosts to receive a small memory of Helsinki's teekkari's visit "this valuable document." "The valuable document" was a receipt issued by the Gothenburg Art Museum. The receipt told that unknown donors had donated the "real artwork" with relevant signatures to the museum collections."
