The Alcohol Act, Alko with its licenses, and the local police authority are obliged to closely monitor those restaurants licensed to serve alcohol follow the given instructions. Opening hours are precisely set, and overtime will be given at the request scarcely and with consideration. Also, the alcohol drinking area and the number of customer places are unambiguously precise. When Dipoli's construction was completed, I invited well in advance before opening the then lensmann of Espoo district Kuno Ahlstedt for a study visit. The reason for the study visit was, among other things, to determine the drinking area and the number of customer places. The drinking area is marked with a uniform red line to official blueprints. The allowed number of customers is calculated based on the floor area and room height.

The drinking area was done with reasonable ease. All 24 halls or cabinets are clearly visible from the blueprints. However, when it was found that the TKY's office, archive, the teekkari organizations' own rooms, which are below the theater hall, and the Polytechnic Museum, which was back then in Dipoli, can not be in the drinking area. It was done as follows: each of the spaces listed above can be accessed from a long-distance lower corridor reserved for teekkaris' usage. That was left out of the drinking area. However, we presented the wish that, in some instances, it should be possible to drink also in the lobby of the theater hall.
Consequently, this space and a part of the cone door's hallway were attached to the banqueting hall's drinking area. This reorganizing followed the following strangeness: you can go from ballrooms to theater hall with a glass in your hand. However, should you want to move with that same glass from the banqueting hall to the beer cellar, then sorry, no way. I  don't know if that's the case anymore. But in the beginning, it was.

As for that number of maximum allowed number of customer definition, my good friend Lensmann and his assistant had a hard time calculating the floor areas. The challenge was especially figuring each room's volumes. In that process, the ordinary measuring tape and try square did not help\*. I do not know whether those values have ever been calculated, even scientifically. As a result, lensmann then, to my recollection, got 3,244 people for the entire building. The number is so huge that there is no way one could fit such an amount of people in. When completed, Dipoli was the largest restaurant in Nothern Europe. I guess it is also today.

\*Translator's remark: Dipoli is not a very symmetrical building."
