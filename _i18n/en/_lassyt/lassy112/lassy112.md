I'm not claiming to be the only one, but there are hardly any who have made UKK\* itself wait with a dry mouth "until at 12 o'clock". I did so out of principle. When the President of the Republic first visited Dipoli, there was an order to offer welcoming cocktails in hall No 4. Be that as it may, Urkki\*\* arrived already 10 minutes before the agreed time at 12.00. I was in my office when TKY's then chairman, Lic. Sc. (Tech.) Olavi Vapaavuori sent his secretary on a running leg to inform me that guests have arrived and the cups must be distributed immediately. I checked my watch by phone from Miss Time and announced that the serving would begin at a legal moment at 12.00. Once again, the courier rushed me to the kitchen side. The courier said that Olavi Vapaavuori would personally be responsible for the serving begins immediately. Mainly in terms of education, I implied that the restaurant has a responsible keeper accepted by Alko. That happens to be me, so one moment. The waiters stood behind the door with glasses filled. When that twelfth moment came, I gave a loud sound signal with the ballroom's gong. The doors opened, and the waiters entered the hall. Is it not so that we are all equal before the law? So be it any law - such as the Alcohol Act.

\*Translator's remark: UKK stands in this context for Urho Kaleva Kekkonen, a former and a very significant Finnish president.

\*\*Translator's remark: Urkki was a "nickname" for the former President Urho Kaleva Kekkonen."
