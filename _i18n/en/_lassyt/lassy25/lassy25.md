# 25. Our Truck NALLE PUH Is Baptised

In the early years of the village, the Finnish Automotive Industry donated a brand new Nalle-Sisu truck. We were naturally overly grateful for the gift, and we asked nurse students to be godparents. The then chairman of TKY, Msc. Techn. Kalevi (Korkki) Korhonen, was the host when the truck was ceremonially christened NALLE PUH.

After having served the village conscientiously and without technical problems, Nalle Puh was promoted from a fuksi to a teekkari. This was done by attaching to the driver's cab's roof's edge a teekkari tassel. The tassel was made of thick ship rope. At the same time, the roof was painted on the outside white. The cap, which was on top of the windshield, was painted black. This teekkari then served the village faithfully for many years.

\*Translator's remark: Nalle Puh means Winnie the Pooh. The word 'nalle' itself implies a teddy bear."
