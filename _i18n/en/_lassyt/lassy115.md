# 115. Jäynäsouls Of Police College. Katila, Aas, Muni

As I now start to slop more about the "eternal battle" between Teekkari Village and the Police College, the three lords from that side of the front are worth mentioning. These three lords were decisive in ensuring that the distance between the two neighbors "tightened to the extreme." They were the first director of the Police College, Police Counselor Olavi Jotuni, the current Moving Police's chief Knut Aas and the actual primus motor, probably known by the village's every single teekkari, Kauko Katila. Katila had taught decades of criminal law to future police officers. Without these gentlemen, nothing would probably have come of anything. They all were chiefs who happened to have tendencies to playful communications, who poured enthusiasm and courage down to their forces. Before beginning my frontline narratives, it is still worth remembering an absolute inequality in combat activity. The Police College courses were short, only a few months long. The entire Police College student body consisted of only two hundred men. When the studies ended, the student body changed into entirely new men. There were almost thousands of us villagers with tassels; the frontline services lasted for years. The enemy probably feared our weapon, the legendary teekkaris' jäynä spirit, which moved to Otaniemi from under the dark roofs of Poli. Remembering these facts, the police officer student's resistance and attacks must be truly considered "heroic.""
