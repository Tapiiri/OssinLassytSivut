I remember how the current King of Sweden, then the Crown Prince of Sweden, visited with Urho Kaleva Kekkonen for the first time in Dipoli. In the lobby, in addition to the official recipients, there was naturally also RWBK. They had just produced their LP record. When the euphonies were played, perhaps its longest activist, Roope Isomäki, stepped out. He pronounced the following elegant Swedish words: "Eder Kungliga höghet. Har Du kanske en grammofon i hemma?"\*. Gustav then announced that yes, he owns such a device in the Stockholm Palace. Roope then continued: "Här skall Du få en ny skiva."\*\* And so, the future king of Sweden was enriched with a truly artistic record. When he was a prince, he visited Otaniemi a couple of times and was once a guest of SIMILISTS in their basement box in TKY 2.

\*Translator's remark: "Your Royal Highness. Do you have a gramophone at home?"

\*\*Translator's remark: "Here, please have a new record.""
