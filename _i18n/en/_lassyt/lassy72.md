# 72. Teekkaris Begin To Participate In Municipal Life

In the mid-1950s, Teekkari Village actually became wholly entangled in municipal life due to the then circumstances. At that time, the students did not politicize at all. Especially teekkaris and, very specifically, the Teekkari Village residents lived in their Ota-Onnela\* under the power of fierce regionalism. The residents were proud of Teekkari Village, the self-directed housing production for students that countless people and excursions came to wonder and admire. That's when the Espoo rural district\*\* registrar ordered that those villagers who have no actual address pointing out the place of residence must be registered in the village of Hagalund in the Espoo rural district.\*\*\* Well, what's in it. The forms were filled, and the population of Espoo increased by almost three hundred residents with the right to vote. This number of votes was then so great that it was guaranteed to be at least for one legal representative to be elected. The search for a suitable "victim" began, and it was the then chairman of TKY, MSc. Techn. Kalevi (Korkki) Korhonen who agreed to fight for the interests of Otaniemi for one election term. The rest was easier of easy. I put a note on the bulletin board to the village's each horn. We then begged for free voting transportation from Espoon Auto. Korkki was elected to the city council with a large number of votes. MSc. Techn. Martti Mutru promised to present Otaniemi in the next election term - this was around the village's completion. The term after that was handled by Msc. Techn. Olavi Kanerva. They all lived in Retuperä\*\*\*\*. The next time we were already playing dangerously by nominating two candidates, the aforementioned Olli Kanerva and MSc. Techn. Antero Salmikivi. Yet these two went through, but with it was very close, they would not have been chosen. That's when the Teekkari Village's own series of "municipal truncheons" ended - the actual politics infiltrated the Village. After that, everyone has probably voted according to their own political passions. Those aforementioned men probably remained to the Espoo council's history to be the only ones who "had become elected" already before the elections. At that time, it "was blown into one coal" in Otaniemi.

\*Translator's remark: this could be freely translated to 'Ota-El Dorado.'

\*\*Translator's remark: Before 1963, Espoo was legally a rural district [maalaiskunta]. In 1963, Espoo was legally changed to a borough [kauppala] and a city in 1972. The more precise translation for 'kauppala' is the Swedish word 'köping.'

\*\*\*Translator's remark: This refers to the Bible's Gospel of Luke, the very beginning of chapter 2.

\*\*\*\*Translator's remark: Retuperä refers to the Otakallio area in Otaniemi, behind the UniSport building."
