In Chalmers, Gothenburg, the local teekkaris of that time traveled in large numbers by using the trams to get to the university. Many teekkaris did not have a car back then, so there were more "friends" in the trams than those trams could hold. The morning tram's driver was always grumpy, roaring and screaming with inappropriate phrases to the teekkaris squeezing inside the tram. When the teekkaris felt that the situation eventually exceeded their tolerance, they decided to "release" that one tram driver from such a heavy task. When this same driver stepped into the tram at the railhead and turned the power on with his key, he noticed that the tram did not move. Only the fuses burned, banging and screaming. When changing the fuses did not help, the mister driver landed down from the wagon and peeked under to find that all four wheels of the wagon were W E L D E D with the expertise to the rails. In the quiet moments of the night, the teekkaris had borrowed welding equipment from the university. Their only altruistic goal was to arrange for the driver "a well-earned extra day of rest he deserved." And that day was wasted before all the wheels were detached from the rails. Did the relationship between the teekkaris and the driver in question improve after that? For me, there is no evidence of any kind. However, I hope that happened."
