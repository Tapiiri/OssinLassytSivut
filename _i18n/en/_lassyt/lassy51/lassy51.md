When the Teekkari Village's maintenance house was completed, the basement of TKY 4 was vacated as the rag store moved away. It was then decided to build a soundproof socializing place here in the basement. Student of Architecture Kalevi Ruokosuo, who probably was then the chairman of the TKY Board, drew up plans for this new banqueting hall - Otagorsu. The work was done entirely as voluntary works, and those lasted for several months. A reason for this such long duration for voluntary works probably was that a famous brewery in Hietalahti promised to take care of the voluntary work beers "as long as the works last." And they indeed did. Let it be mentioned of the unique features of Otagorsu that 1) you can sit on the floor and let your legs hang freely. 2) There was the only wholly legless dining table owned by the City of Espoo. 3) There was also a cabinet made of 5,000-liter oak barrels. In connection to an exchange sitsit, 18 teekkari girls and boys were squeezed into those barrels to enjoy the hosts' mysterious conclave nectars. The hosts provided the nectar."
