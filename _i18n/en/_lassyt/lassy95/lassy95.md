# 95. A Princess of Denmark In Otaniemi

One of the Danish princesses stopped by at Helsinki and performed in all her business, just a sightseeing tour in Otaniemi. Teekkaris were with overalls on and buckets of water and toilet sponges in their hands at the Dipoli's curve. Teekkaris intended to "WASH QUICKLY THE CAR WINDOWS" so that Her Royal Highness would have better seen the beauty of Otaonnela\*. However, this did not happen. Police officers driving in front of the car caravan noticed the standing teekkaris in their overalls. They thought those are at least terrorists who are going to murder the princess. So the police rushed out of their cars and pushed the overall monsters out of the way. After that, by fiercely increasing the speed, the car caravan drove out of Otaniemi.

\*Translator's remark: this could be translated as "Ota-El Dorado.""
