When Teekkari Village was being built, a teekkari group from the University of Toronto from Canada arrived as guests. They had as their tour guide professor Nicolas Ingnatjeff - despite his name, he was a diehard Canadian. They were here for a while, helping, e.g., in the construction works of Rantasauna. The friendship between the teekkaris of Helsinki and Toronto originates from this event. When the said professor Ignatjeff died suddenly in his homeland, a bilingual copper plate was engraved to commemorate their visit to tell about this visit. The plate was attached to the outer wall of the sauna building. It was then unveiled during the Helsinki Olympic Games. At the unveiling ceremony were represented no more and no less than the Dukes of Edinburgh and Kent, Archbishop of Gathebury, and numerous other eminences. Castle warden Olli Mykk√§nen was the only one who was granted the luck to squeeze those royal hands, and so he then walked for the whole day, hand supported by a cloth on the chest. For one Finnish Mark's reasonable compensation, the willing were then allowed to smell the royal scent coming from that hand."
