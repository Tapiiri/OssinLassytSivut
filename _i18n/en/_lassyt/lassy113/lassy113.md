When the TKY's official circles from autumn 1959 began their work on getting a new student union building to Otaniemi, I started in my half-play to slop the word Dipoli. This means the second Poli along the Lönnrotinkatu along with the first Poli, i.e., Monopoli. Be that as it may, the word clung ever so tightly to the palate of the teekkari people. So much so that later, when an official competition was declared to invent a name, it bore no fruit. So the name Dipoli remained permanent. Instead, the name Tripolis, which I suggested for the TF's nation-building, did not sell itself. This was the case even though their Urdskjällar was the third amusement apartment built by polytechnicians."
