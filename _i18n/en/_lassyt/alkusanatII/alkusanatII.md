# The second rambling edition's foreword
When in 1982, I had made this book's first edition, I honestly thought that I had pumped myself empty from the memories of Otaniemi. Nothing of that kind. But then, from my memories, swamps come to surface such jäynäs and events from Teekkari Village, that I see it as nothing less than my duty to bring those to this day's knowledge as "a lesson and a correction for future generations." And on the other hand, I have ended up after the first edition, to my great joy and "without my own fault" to that kind of teekkarirumbles, that it would be a teekkarihistorical shame unless it would not be told to posterity.

Now dear reader, sit down easily and relax to your chair or the corner of your sofa, mute your radio, the TV, or the volume coming from the people around you, open up this book, and receive the gushing the real teekkari spirit. Teekkaris have created this spirit during the decades. My modest part is just an attempt to register somehow, inventory, and document it.
