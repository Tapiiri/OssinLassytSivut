I have already told stories about Teekkari Village's famous Rantasauna and, among other things, how almost every teekkari sauna session became a steam vapor competition. Once, however, we went to another extreme. The competition arose who would walk the longest distance on Laajalahti ice in a biting frosty evening connected to the sauna bathing. Well, what's in it. The rules were clear, and the whole sauna team rushed naked on the ice, disappearing to the twilight of the night. From there, they then quite soon began to return with a terrific speed back to the sauna's excellent steam vapors. Everybodys' tip of the nose was white, and the toes were blue. When we thought all had returned to the sauna and the winner was thus determined, the whole race was forgotten. Everyone concentrated on frying sausages along with sipping beer every now and then. But the competition once again returned quite radically to the minds of sauna people. After a long pause, the front door opened yet once more. Inside stepped a shivering teekkari who was almost frozen solid. He melted himself in the steam room for a while and then said: "Bloody bouncer as he did not let me inside." Hooray. A gold medal man of a new Finnish sport was found. In addition to the immortal honor, he received at least one extra beer."
