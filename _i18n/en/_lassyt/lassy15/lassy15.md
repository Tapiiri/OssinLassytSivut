My numerous acquaintances and the representatives of the older age groups who visited Teekkari Village asked me the same question: "how in such a village of young residents village - with almost a thousand residents - is any order maintained. And when the residents are, above all, teekkaris who are known legendarily from their escapades and celebrations". I was asked countless times, and there was great wondering how I, who had already passed middle-age, endured that pressure with my wife and my minor children. You see, I lived in the upper dormitory of the bachelor tower, also known as C-tower. Thus, below me lived about a hundred teekkaris. It may be that a "regular" person with an average length of spring would not have been able to digest all that in 17 years, but as unbelievable as it may now afterward sound, those were the best years of my life. And my whole family agrees. There was never a dull and monotonous moment. Every day was different, and you always got to be equipped to face the out abnormal."
