Shortly before Christmas in 1952, I was informed by the Customs Chamber of the Port of Helsinki that there would be a consignment addressed to Teekkari Village ready for pick up. I thought the shipment was a book or something like that size, so I went to the harbor in a small passenger car. The customs officer smiled when he guided me to the storehouse. The consignment was a wooden box, and it was over 6 meters long, sent by The University of Toronto.  A bigger vehicle than an ordinary passenger car was truly needed to drag the box to Otaniemi. From inside revealed a beautiful Canadian Indian canoe, Toronto's "little memory" from their visit to Finland and our teekkari group's visit to Toronto. By the way, our group built a Finnish sauna on the Caledon farm. The University of Toronto owns the farm. I remember at least the teekkaris Jukka Lehtinen and Matti Kaario being involved in this work. When the canoe arrived, we rapidly arranged a handover party to Servin Mökki. The donator there was the then chargé d'affaires of Canada, Mr. Weinman-Wood. The canoe was christened "Caledon" by the farm mentioned above. This canoe then became the ceremonial canoe of Teekkari Village and by which it was always on 13.5. paddled to the shore of Helsinki's Market Square, the Otaniemi Spring Greeting. More on that later."
