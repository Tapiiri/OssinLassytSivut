Our next attack on the Police College was a complete success. Still, we used as a deciding factor something utterly new weapon - only for this purpose established air forces. With the help of detailed beer and other tests, the Castle Warden Host chose from the villagers such a commando group, whose heads lasted the most. Next, another black and dark night came - a commando group progressed silently to the college wall. Then they climbed the fire escape ladders upwards while perfectly controlling their nerves. From there, they performed their strike straight down. On the house's cornice edging, which was painted black, appeared text "Midwifery College." What a breathtaking situation. Teekkari A hangs almost entirely head down from the eaves, while teekkaris B and C hold from the legs. And the text still needs to be painted upside down. This kind of performance is only possible for a significantly trimmed and practiced elite group."
