In the past, in Teekkari Village's housing applications, we switched from paper forms to SPEEDEX punch cards. The SPEEDEX punch cards were of the A5 size, and all of their edges were perforated. For each hole, there was a text telling the purpose of the hole. The affirmative answer to the hole's question was obtained with special notching pliers, which turned into an open hole. When the cards were upright in a box, and a long steel needle was inserted through the entire card weight and lifted, remained the notched, i.e., positive answer cards in the box. The negative cards rise. This greatly facilitated the processing of applications. When we designed these cards, there was one hole that was "a leftover." When Irma and I did not come up with anything else, we put to this hole a text "to notch or not to notch." An estimated 96% of applicants returned to the office to ask should that spot be notched or not."
