Once again, a village's teekkari was about to become with a good pace a FILM SLIDE. In all its chemistry, the course of action was the following. Leaving from under Poli's dark ceilings to celebrate Vappu eve, ensured teekkari X the moisture of homecoming by placing a bottle of "rapids' shimmering" to his room's sanitary closet. To be more precise, in the left corner of the bottom shelf. As always, the eve went joyfully in Poli, and in the morning, our returned to his home to Teekkari Village 3 C, "perhaps wobbling a little bit." He headed to the sanitary closet with determined steps and took the bottle from the lower shelf's left corner. He opened the cap and did he take a tidy gulp indeed to his thirsty throat. - - -

After that, the castle warden Anders Jalava called me in the early hours. He said we have to immediately go take a hero to the ER of Maria's Hospital\*. Soon the village's van was driving fast along Jorvaksentie to Helsinki. The van was carrying a roaring, growling, cursing, and puking student of technology X. They had made only one small mistake when they returned to his home at night; that teekkari had gone due to oversight and in the dark to the dormitory, which was above his own. And in the corresponding room of that dormitory, a teekkari camera activist lived thereâ€”however, that teekkari stored in their sanitary closet film developing liquid called METOLHYDROKINON in liquor bottles. Our hero had then ingested the aforementioned liquid with the aforementioned consequences. However, with care and affection, the nurse emptied our hero from the liquid. He got already the next business day back home. For weeks the villagers had a fun reason to stop our hero at the village road and examine the conch to see if the world's first TEEKKARI-FILM SLIDE is still developed.

\*Translator's remark: ER = Emergency Room. Maria's Hospital was located at Lapinlahdenkatu 16, Helsinki, and was shut down in 2009."
