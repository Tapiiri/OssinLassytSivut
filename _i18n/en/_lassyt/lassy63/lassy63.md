One day, the cavemen came to my apartment as a solemn act inviting me to be an honorary member. At the same time, they donated to me the Cavemen's first "honor molkku" along with chains and the deed of conveyance. The deed of conveyance mentions that the honor molkku must be worn in front of other badges of honor. Molkku is an egg-shaped natural stone weighing a couple of kilograms, and it has the letter L engraved on it. A 65 cm long thick chain is attached to the stone with a leather dog collar at the other end. When you hand this "magnificent" badge around your neck, the molkku automatically sets before the others."
