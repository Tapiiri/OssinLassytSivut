# 123. Police Students Redeem Our Beer Cart From KOP

After moving to Otaniemi, police students took part in every Vappu to the village's traditional beer relay. At the start of a relay, it was officially announced that the losing team was obliged to turn over a beer basket for the winners. The police students lost that match, and of course, they had no beer baskets with them. We gave them two weeks of payment time. Nothing was heard of payment. We contacted Pertti Soini, who was then the director of Otaniemi KOP\*. As a lawyer, he stated that nowhere is it mentioned that the only measure of value would be money in banking. The castle warden host took an empty wooden beer basket and wrote to a plank a draft. It was verified the student body of Police College being indebted to Teekkari Village's Castle Warden Host a beer basket. In other words, 24 bottles of beer. The draft was swung to OTA-CABIN, which with an official form, informed the college of the draft's redemption requirement plus two bottles as bank charges. The police students redeemed the draft from the bank on the draft's due date, bringing 24 bottles. The bottles were wrapped beautifully in cellophane. Two bottles of bank charges were without wrappers. So they avoided the same having their name appear in the Official Journal's protest list - apparently to the new section of "fallen beer drafts.".

\*Translator's remark: KOP (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki) was a bank chain in Finland at that time."
