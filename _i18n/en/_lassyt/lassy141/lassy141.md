Finally, from this place. I have now dug my gray brain cells empty from the memories of Otaniemi. Those are printed above. I hope I have remembered correctly what I have remembered—you former otanist, who has now bravely waded here. Suppose I have told something wrong or too lamely. Do not accept it. Make a protest. You can easily do it orally. Directly to me. Here in my Tapiola chamber. Tapiola is, as you may remember, one of the border villages of Otaniemi. My window shows the port city of Otaniemi, Helsinki, in the background. Right in front of me is a rather tall office building, where amongst other things, is working teekkari (retired from active service) Jaakko Ihamuotila.

However, before you come, call 463 087, so that before you arrive a) I feed my forever hungry Great Dane Danilo Gerjos Shilo Of Airvays (height at the withers +15 cm compared to my former Doora) and b) I take one littubottle\* to room temperature. If the phone does not immediately respond, do not be discouraged. Danilo is then taking me out for a walk.

And you, my dear ordinary reader. Should you not understand anything aforementioned, the situation is solved with the so-called trick of two hands. The left hand closes the book, and the right throws it into the wastebasket.

\*Translator's remark: in ramble 142, Ossi explains that this is a play on words. A round bottle = pytty. A flat bottle = littu. Littu is the same as a hip flask. This itself is a play on the Finnish word "litteä" (flat)."
