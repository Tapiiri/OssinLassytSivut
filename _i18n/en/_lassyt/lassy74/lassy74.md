When the TKY representative council was established and the first elections approached, it caused quite a bustle in the village. Those 45 elected representatives would, among other things, ratify the annual budget of TKY. The village rents and food prices at Servin MÃ¶kki would play a significant role in the yearly budget. The villagers formed an actual election headquarters, where the candidates' list was drawn up with scientific precision. When the election days came, each dormitory received a written "instruction" from the headquarters, how the line should be drawn. And so great was the corner patriotism of the village at that time that the result of the election was precisely in accordance with the preliminary calculations. As a result, 23 representatives from the village were elected, i.e., an absolute majority. Naturally, there was one factor that had an impact on the results. The villagers were able to play at the home field, i.e., they could vote at the fireplace hall of TKY 3. Those who lived in Helsinki had to drag themselves to Poli."
