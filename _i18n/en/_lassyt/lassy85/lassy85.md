# 85. Two Peace Congresses At The Same Time

There were two more than a thousand people congresses so tightly consecutive. There was the first congress that pursued secular world peace, and it ended in due time. Then on the next day, there was immediately a deeply religious congress on the very next day and replaced the first one. A couple of days before the agreed end date with the first one, its representatives came to me with a request to continue their event with one day. I said that would be impossible because a new meeting would be already the next day. However, I could not prevent these two ideologies from negotiating with each other. It just so happened that the first one continued its "defensive action" yet for one day. The profoundly religious meeting participants slept their first night on the floors of Lauttasaari, Espoo, and Helsinki schools. They slept on straw mattresses, which had temporarily been delivered there. On top of all that, a significant part of them had families and had their children with them. Who still doubts the power of peace will. Whether it was secular or spiritual. And that power did the cleaning manager Jenny Löfberg with her assistants. In one day, 422 rooms in Teekkari Village had to be cleaned and "makeup." From that piecework, a contract was the peace far away. But that was done. Per aspera ad astra\*.
