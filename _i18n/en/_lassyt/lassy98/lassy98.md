And as the last story regarding the chapel I should tell about a plant donation from a certain engineer’s missus. She made the donation for the Guild of the Cross, the members of which used them to decorate the chapel with great excitement. There were ordinary pot plants and several large vines. The wooden beam construction inside the chapel was an ideal match for the vines and soon a horde of vines was surrounding every beam. And so it was until Heikki Siren once again arrived to present his creation to visitors. After a “heartfelt and constructive conversation” between the then-chairman of the Guild of the Cross M. Sc. Lasse Kivekäs and Heikki Siren the guild made a re-evaluationn of the situation and the aforementioned plants were moved to Servin Mökki, the roof structures of which also offered suitable forms for vines. For the longest time the chapel remained open day and night. Doors were never locked. And nothing particularly bothersome occurred. There was even a selection of postcards inside with a request to pay the purchased card to a chest next to it. For the longest time the accords of these card sales matched amazingly well. Particularly to foreigners this seemed quite incredible. There they were, cards and money on an open shelf - with all the doors open.
