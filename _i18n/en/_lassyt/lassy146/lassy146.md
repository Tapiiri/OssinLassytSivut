Compared to the Cone statue, which I described earlier, INTERNATIONAL MONEY-METER was incomparably much more trustworthy, installed to the Teekkari Hall\* of Dipoli.

Teuvo Turunen made a mercury thermometer-like contraption with temperature lines and numbers from battenboard about 1.5 m high and 0.5 m wide. Instead of a glass tube and mercury, a clear 2" thick straight transparent acrylic pipe was installed in the middle. The bottom of the pipe was tightly sealed. Hurrah. The gadget was ready. It was fixed firmly against the wall. At the top end - at the open pipe were the following six foreign words: "INTERNATIONAL MONEY-METER Put the coins here."

The result. The 1.5 m acryl tube was filled from time to time with coins of all kinds. These coins were dragged by Liisa Jutila (our chief cashier) to the bank to deposit again to some TKY's bank account to the KOP\* girls' chagrin.

I recommend a similar new device. The idea is that the device digitally captures from a tourist's wallet automatically one or two banknotes. Then it converts those in real time to Finnish currency and drops to the victim's hand the corresponding amount of ÄPYs and JULKKUs\*\*\* or some other teekkaris' culture publications.

\*Translator's remark: after TKY sold Dipoli to Aalto University, Teekkari hall's name was renamed to Pinecone Lobby at some point.

\*\*Translator's remark: as mentioned a few rambles earlier, KOP (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki) was a bank at that time. It later merged with Suomen Yhdyspankki in 1995.

\*\*\*Translator's remark: Wappumagazine JULKKU is published in even years (for example, 2020, 2022, etc.). Wappumagazine ÄPY is published on uneven years (2019, 2021, 2023, etc.). Those are sold near Wappu (1.5.) and a bit after it."
