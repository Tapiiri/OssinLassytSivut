# 133. The Host Of Tippavaara Visits The Village

As the autumn term approached its end in December, the castle wardens, in their mercy, announced to the Otapeople of the Little Christmas Day. Thus, for some reason, an essential part of this traditional celebration, pipeshouting, was concentrated for the shortest possible period of time. According to the tradition, this was done because there lived such teekkaris who studied and even as Christmas approached. It once happened that during such a collective village festival, there was in Dipoli a closed celebration of some organization. This celebration's performer was, amongst other things, Tippavaara Host\*, Oke Tuuri, who had a formidable reputation from his performance. I was in Dipoli, and I came up with the idea to ask the Host of Tippavaara to come to mark the Village's celebrating events. And how come. After the host had taken care of his work at Dipoli, he left with me to Teekkari Village. As we were heading to the Village, he said he could stop by at a maximum of two dormitories. Naturally, no one did know about this visit to the Village. We started from TKY 3A and moved from dormitory to dormitory. One can only imagine that astonishment and the joyful roaring that followed when the Host of Tippavaara himself walked into the dormitory. Well. In every dormitory, this prestigious guest was entertained by all available means and materials. This eventually led to my guide's role changing to piloting when mister host smiling and singing, sailed from dormitory to dormitory and from castle to castle. This whole thing lasted far until the morning hours, after which I drove the host home safely in the direction of Käpylä\*\*. When I called in the following day and thanked him, Oke Tuuri said that he had never acted on 91 different scenes on the same night. And so, successfully. Yes, teekkaris know how to give value to real art.

\*Translator's remark: the name "Tippavaara's Host" refers to a radio program, "Kankkulan kaivolla," broadcasted by Finnish Broadcasting Company 1958-1970 and was popular at that time.

\*\*Translator's remark: Käpylä is a district of Helsinki."
