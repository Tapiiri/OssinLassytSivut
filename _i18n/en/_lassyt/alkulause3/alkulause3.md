Errare humanum est. Sometimes even twice.
As in my case.
When in 1982, I had made the first and 1987 my second lässycollection, I thought in both times, that "this is all folks."

But nothing of the kind. For some reason, I always end up to such a jäynätumult that those just must be put to paper.
Now there are only two of these new events.
Still, both are so great teekkarijäynäs that those are sure to remain in the Otaniemi teekkarihistory.
Especially as every later coming word is accurate.
I know that it is hard for the reader to believe for all parts, but lets at least try.
