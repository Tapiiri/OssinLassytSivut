It was once spent the Bolterabend of the current MSc. Techn. Heikki Koivula at Rantasauna. Steam vapors were intense, as well as food and, above all, the drinks. Gradually, the bridegroom and also other guests then started to pass out. The fireplace's quiet crackling was intermingled with the loud snoring of the partygoers lying on the benches. Then in the middle of the night came yet one guest from the city, and so big was the rush with this guest to the party that he came in from the large picture window of the fireplace room. The glass pieces just flew everywhere. Heikki, the bridegroom, was first to wake up to this hullabaloo, and he yelled out: "Get up, boys. The glass master's herring I have ordered seems to be coming.""
