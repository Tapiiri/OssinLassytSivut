# 89. The PLH Required To Each Point Of Central Radio A Separate License

PLH startled us also by another time. This time they notified us that each central radio listening point in the wall can be interpreted to be a radio listening device. Thus, for each device, a listening permit would have to be redeemed. There were then 422 rooms and 91 dormitory halls. In other words, 513 new permits. We sent a written statement of defense to PLH. We proved that the village's central radio is mainly an electrotechnical educational tool for teekkaris. It has been built as practical work. Utilizing it, the electrical department students continuously carry out their essential research and design work.

If this explanation would not have been enough, we still had in our "back pocket" an "installation idea," which is the same as in the chart below. As the chart show, we would have completely given up on listening to the Finnish Broadcasting Company's programs - save for one device which had the legal permit. We would have used that device to record the program. We would have listened to this recording "sometime later" with a different tape recorder and, what is more, "in a different place." Thus, it was not radio listening per se, much less a public presentation. We would have listened to these in our homes' intimacy with our very own recorder hardware these programs, news, and time signals which were broadcasted in ancient times. There were no significant problems regarding programs and news. However, in the case of time signals, one should have considered the time the tape's point would have needed for the journey from the first recorder's E to the second's H. Such a delay, for example, from dates could have been even fateful for a teekkari.

I do not know how this thing later developed. I remained "on the table" after I left Otaniemi. It would be quite interesting to know how listening to the tape, according to our idea, could have been proven to such listening of a Finnish Broadcasting Company's program in such a way that every listening device would need a permit. When we came up with the idea, we were entirely sure of the idea's functionality. With antenna A's help, the broadcast receiver B receives the program from the air, which is being broadcasted. It is recorded in real-time by the recorder C on the annular tape D at the magnetic head E. The tape passes into room 2 through hole F to the recorder G, which plays the program using the magnetic head H. The amplifier unit I feeds the tape program to the speakers J. The tape goes back to room 1 through the hole K in the wall. There it goes to the recorder C. Recorder C's second magnetic head I deletes the program before the new recording of point E."
