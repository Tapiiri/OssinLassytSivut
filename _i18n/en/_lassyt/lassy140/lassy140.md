And at least yet once more, Irma arranged stuff for me, and now it happened 2.4.1980. It was the same day when I was entitled to the fundamental part of the Basic Pension. The doorbell in my apartment rang, and there was a new door behind it when I opened it. Or rather, it was a new old door. Under Irma's leadership, the village board members carried me to the Teekkari Village's door 3 C 93. That room served as our bedroom when we lived there in the village's C-horn's upper dormitory. Indeed, it is a door to past memories. With the door came yet a teekkari quartet and village office's other girls with ready-made oatmeal and fizz. Those were welcomed provisions for a retired older man."
