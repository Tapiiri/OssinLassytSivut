In connection with the joint sitsit at Otaniemi's Rantasauna, I often uttered a pearl of my collection of aphorisms: "If there was even a female police, I'd f..k police". However, my delicate poem ran out of use suddenly. When the police arrived at the sauna again, there were Knut Aas with charming female police officers in uniform in both his arms. He handed them to me, saying, "There you go.""
