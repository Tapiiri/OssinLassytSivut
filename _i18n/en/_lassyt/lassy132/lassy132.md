And when people graduated, of course, it had to be celebrated. It had to be celebrated so that at least your own dormitory, your own horn\*, your own castle\*\*, and if possible, the whole village knew. So when the gentleman's horn in the top dormitory of 3C (I lived with my family half a floor below) lived Antero Tiilikka. He was also known as Tintero or Tintero Aalikka. Once Tintero graduated, this final process took about two weeks. But as he was a gentleman, Tintero was also worried about my family's domestic peace. So during the hardest party night, Tintro then faithfully rang my doorbell at average intervals of two hours. When I swayed as drowsy to open the door, he asked each time: "I hope this my graduation ceremony does not bother you in any way? If it does, then the only way is to increase the liquor proportions". However, this only resort did not work until eight when my wife and I left for work. But at least Tintero had tried. So it should not be denied.

\*Translator's remark: the term "horn" refers to the dormitory's elder. A single dormitory had 6-12 residents at that time.

\*\*Translator's remark: the term "castle" refers to a single TKY-building of that time, now part of AYY."
