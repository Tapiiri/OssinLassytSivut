# 26. The Fire Truck SUIHKU-SIWIÄ Gets New Tires

In this context, the christening of another car must be told. The fire truck FORD model T-1928 was given by Serlachius Group to Retuperä Orchestra, and it chugged anonymously. Once Oy Ford Ab's sales manager, major Rahunen, happened to ask how our fire truck was doing. I said everything was otherwise fine, but the tires were pretty much worn out. He got excited about the matter and contacted his foreman in the USA. It was reported that the production of high-pressure tires of T-model Ford was ended a long time ago. However, the Firestone factory has promised to take the molds from its museum and fry for us those four tires. And so, on a fine day, there was once again a festival at Hietalahti Market Square. Representatives of Oy FORD Ab, who acted as godparents, donated brand new slippers to their goddaughter. The fire truck was named SUIHKU-SIWIÄ. This name was obtained as a result of an announced name contest. The second prize went to the proposal POLY-TRUCK. This name was then redeemed by Servi's Maija as the name of her future vehicle. She will transport food in the future to polytechnics in Otaniemi with that vehicle."
