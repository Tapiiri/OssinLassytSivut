# 59. Rector Jaakko Rahola Gets Lost In His Own University Building

The main building of TKK in Otaniemi is really like the Pentagon of the USA with its long and twisting corridors in its depths. However, it was an actual maze at the beginning of the first semester, when part of the house was taken into use while the rest was still a construction site. These two parts were separate from each other with temporary partition walls and locked doors. Once upon a time, it happened so that I was walking in a corridor of the finished part. The then rector of TKK, professor Jaakko Rahola, came up against me with busy steps. Visibly relieved of our meeting, he said: "Listen, by which way do I get out of here?". When I guided the rector out to "freedom," I could not resist the temptation to joke: "It was fortunate that we met. Otherwise, tomorrow's newspaper's main news' headline could have included the following dramatic headline: 'Yesterday the TKK's rector Jaakko Rahola left to his new building - disappearing into the unknown.'""
