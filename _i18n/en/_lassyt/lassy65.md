# 65. A Miraculous Spring In The Atomic Cave

During its many years of construction, the Otaniemi Atomic Cave brought us a lot of fun and "utilities." There was also a tiny cave lake for some time, about an acre in size and a couple of meters of water. Once again, there were the representatives of the THS\* from Stockholm visiting us. They, too, were dragged into the cave. They were finally taken to the shore of that cave lake into the ghostly twilight of storm lanterns. There was no electric lighting. We explained to the guests that this was the only known underground source of wishes in the world. In support of our claim, one of our people threw a coin over his left shoulder and pronounced his desire: "Jag ville gärna ha en flaska öl."\*\* A moment passed. The spring started to effervesce strangely. After a while, a terrible-looking monster rose from there, whatever an Iku-Turso\*\*\* that was. The beast had not only one flaska\*\*\*\* but a whole basket of beer. Once again, there was a frogman on the matter, taking care of the show skillfully. He was waiting in the cave's twilight. After hearing the wish, he dove into the water. The basket was waiting in the water.

\*Translator's remark: THS = 'Tekniska Högskolan i Stockholm' [University of Technology in Stocholm] at that time. As of 2021, it is now known as the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

\*\*Translator's remark: "I'd like to have a bottle of beer."

\*\*\*Translator's remark: A sea monster in the Kalevala epic poetry.

\*\*\*\*Translator's remark: flaska = a bottle."
