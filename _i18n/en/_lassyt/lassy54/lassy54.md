# 54. TKY's Board Tests Servi's Alarm Devices

One summer evening, the then board of TKY was sitting at Otaniemi Rantasauna. The student union chairman was then MSc. Techn. Kalevi (Korkki) Korhonen. From the others who were present, I remember two; architect Esko Mäkelä and MSc. Techn. Jukka Lehtonen. At one point, I had boasted about the alarm devices of Servin Mökki. That was when the lord consuls got an idea to try the truth of my words. Well, all right. We went with my key inside in the silence of the night without breaking anything. We wandered without lightning the lights across the call to the cabinet and remained there in real darkness and silence. It took a couple of minutes, and we heard the maintenance speaking from the kitchen when they came inside with their own keys. The situation began to become so tense that one of those sitting in the cabinet whispered to me that he would leave. He was going to exit by the window. However, this remained just as an idea. Because at the same time, maintenance man Määttänen around the cabinet to check the situation. Well. After clacking in the kitchen and in the hall and cursing became finally the moment that the cabinet door was rushed open and the maintenance man group rumbled in. And that's where we sat. After the chairman's excellent speech and handing over a quick collection, we received forgiveness from our conscientious maintenance personnel. The board found Servin Mökki's equipment to be efficient."
