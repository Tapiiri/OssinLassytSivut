# 31. Pile Driving Of The River Kwai

Over the years, I gave my own sermons to the villagers. I tried to prove that the residents could also consider other leisure art forms in their dormitory instead of a night-long pipe cry\*. Once there was a significant noise coming from a C horn dormitory \*\*. This was continuously mixed with equally-paced intense music pounding. I rushed to that dormitory and roared, "What the h\*ll is this noise all about?"

In his response, the dormitory's eldest pronounced his wondering that I first urge residents to have other hobbies than just pipe shouting. Now, when they do other hobbies, I come to disturb the event by shouting, "stop this event." The dormitory eldest then told that this was a practice session of a drama club. The practice subject was currently a pile-driving scene from the play "The Bridge of the River Kwai." What else could I do but apologize for the disruption I caused to the art session and leave to the front right.

\*Translator's remark: pipe shouting probably refers to wild parties and other noisy activities. It is the nickname given by Ossi for such activities.

\*\*Translator's remark: horn refers to a building part. For example, TKY 3 has three different 'horns'; A, B, and C."
