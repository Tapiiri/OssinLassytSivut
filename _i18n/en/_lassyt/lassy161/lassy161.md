When this Student Village of Otaniemi (Teekkari Village), built and owned by Finnish technology students, was inaugurated in 1952 by the President of the Republic of Finland, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, not even two months had passed when the athletics of OLYMPIC GAMES OF HELSINKI in 1952 populated it with the power of more than 1,500 men and women. At that time, the memorable OLYMPIC GAMES were held at that time in Helsinki. That was the starting point of the cooperation between Otaniemi and athletes. The cooperation has continued during the summer uninterruptedly for 30 summers. During the decades, all kinds of sized and colored athletes have visited here. When we students leave our village to practice in the industry, we are pleased and proud that our village is suitable for international sports teams.

And now is the height of it all. Our village receives an honorable and, at the same time, a binding mission to act as THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE FIRST WORLD ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS...

While we teekkaris warmly welcome every athlete to our village, we sincerely hope that everyone here will enjoy themselves and then achieve on the tracks of our glorious Olympic Stadium as outstanding achievements as then in 1952. Let us remember the human locomotive Emil Zatopeck and his Mrs. Zatopkowa. They took four gold medals from the Games as their souvenirs. Otaniemi has 30 years of sports traditions. We hope those encouraging those living here today as well. You all are warmly welcome to Otaniemi!
