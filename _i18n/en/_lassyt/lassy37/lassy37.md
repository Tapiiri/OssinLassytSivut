# 37. I Was A Pancake A.D. 1882

Once Servi's Maija's brats, or dispenser, made such a gross error that they had given a pancake to a teekkari of the Architecture Department. The underside of that pancake was fried undeniably a little bit too brown. It was soon stated that such a violation had happened, and this was quickly witnessed d by the whole village and others who had stopped by at Servin Mökki. Calmly but still with dignity, our future architect took that pancake in their room. Then the teekkari texted to its brown surface in excellent, skillful multicolored work sentence: "I Was A Pancake A.D. 1882". Like Martin Luther, that guy nailed that pancake with 4-inch wire nails firmly to the oak main door of Servin Mökki. This work of art was remained there for a long time to tell all the people what had happened. And that amount of people was by no means few in number. For example, during Ski Sundays, many hundred lunch guests stopped by at Servin Mökki to find Servi's Maija's schnitzels to be the best in the world. Before the Lehtisaari's bridge, we plowed in the winter road from Munkkiniemi to Otaniemi. Walkers and motorists arrived in Otaniemi on Sundays as an uninterrupted stream."
