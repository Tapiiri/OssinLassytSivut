From year to year, the same rigmarole continued in the village office. Inna and Eeva distributed to those who passed the qualifying course rooms, and more than clearly, those always run out. One fall, we made the "naughty jäynä." There is a door at TKY III's A-B corridor that takes to the green of the building. We put inside that door a note with the text "B 99". When the last actual room was given, the next poor fuksi received from Inna the B 99 note. Inna mentioned that the room was very bright and equipped with perfect air conditioning. The victim rushed to that door, opened it - and ended up in the green outdoors. We watched the victim's facial expression from the window, followed, and nevertheless gave the victim the right bed in the right room."
