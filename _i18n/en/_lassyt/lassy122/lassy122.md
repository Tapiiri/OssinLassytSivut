# 122. A Cottid To Police Counselor Eloranta

When Police Counselor Eloranta turned 50, we only found out about it the day before in the evening, so there was no longer any opportunity to purchase any gift. The castle warden host thought of the situation, forehead wrinkled. One of the castle wardens had gone fishing and mentioned that he had caught, e.g., about a 10cm long cottid. That's one of the ugliest creatures in the world with leather covers, beards, spikes, and bands. The cottid was still as uncleaned on the host's balcony, among other catches. We marched cottid with us to the village repair shop and started to dip it in a cellulose lacquer bowl. After dipping, it was always placed on an iron hook to dry. When the surface felt dry, it was always re-dipped to the lacquer. Little by little on the monster's surface became a glassy and transparent surface. Finally, it began to resemble some Chinese porcelain object. We made a square base on it from a piece of oak plank, on which was written by Letra-set font:

"To Police Counselor Viljo Eloranta on his 50th birthday. Otaniemi teekkaris."

To the other edge of the base came the text:

"Cottid - fiscus dentus".

With the cottid in the armpit, we then marched to other numerous delegations to the honorable man's apartment, where the main castle warden handed over the present with a smile of congratulation. The police counselor thanked him for his congratulations and for the gift he received. He put the gift on the cover of his home grand piano, among the other art objects. When after two weeks I met Eloranta on Otaniemi road and asked for news, he said he had already recovered from the festival back to everyday life. This transition phase had also been accelerated to some extent by a gift cottid, the guts of which within the lacquered armor began to "live" in the room temperature. As a result, pressure arose, which cracked the shell, and rather a familiar smell filled the residence of the police counselor. The cottid faced quite a fast eviction by Mrs. Eloranta into the open air."
