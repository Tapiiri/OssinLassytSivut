Scattered information from the Teekkari Village's record book OTA-GUINNESS. Bookkeeper teekkari h.c. OSSI 1952-1969.

The Biggest

`item that was forgotten to Teekkari Village = grand piano.`

The Biggest

`an object crammed in a toilet bowl and stuck in a drain = baby carriage (however a plastic toy).`

The Greatest

`accommodation tensity. In the summer -52, 1554 Olympic Games, athletes lived in Otaniemi's TKY III-IV-V for three weeks. Plus me, the missus and four puppies.`

The Greatest

`Bachelor Villages' (III-IV-V) child density was in 1959. Puppies (=teekkari descendants) were, measured in live weight, about 0.2 m3. In approximation, 92 pieces. The precise number was never obtained; x was a rapidly changing parameter.`

The Greatest

`occupancy of one room in TKY IV. 1 teekkari + 1 missus + 2 puppies + 1 mother-in-law + 1 Schäfer dog. However, only one teekkari was marked to live there.`

The Biggest

`flower donation to Teekkari Village. When gardener Helling donated in one spring 5,000 onions of narcissuses. (And each of those was planted into the area of the village).`

The Greatest

`amount of crowd at the same time in Otaniemi. In Midsummer Feast -53, there were about 15,000 (5,000 people had crawled to Otaniemi before the ticket sales began, then 5,000 tickets were sold, and then came yet another 5,000 people who were wobbling without tickets as those had been already sold out).`

The Longest

`teekkari ceremony in Village 3 hours 15 mins. When 399 teekkaris stopped by at me, donating me 399 yo-yos.`

The shortest

`teekkari ceremony in village 5,5 seconds. When an unknown teekkari, Tynkkynen, attempted to be shot from TKY III's chimney to orbit. However, this orbit ended 5 meters away from that end of the chimney, when that teekkari (= straw doll) plumped amongst the prestigious festive audience at Vappu rowdiness declaration.`

The most modest

`representation event. When TKY was once again so poor that the TKY was able to provide to the delegation of the Parliamentary Finance Committee one (1) single link sausage and a total of two (2) bottles of beer (one for each sex).`

The most authoritative

`chick dance in Teekkari Villages 30th anniversary celebration = look at the picture (as performed by Professor Heikki Siren und ich). The performance just as long as it took OUBS technicians to repair the amplifier equipment.`

The heaviest

`testicles in Otaniemi. The giant ones of Jämeräbearded Engineers, which are still kicking about in front of Servin Mökki.`

The eldest

`sign of the beginning of teekkari activities in Otaniemi. More than 5,000-year-old Stone Age grave in front of TKY III. (When anthropologists dug the grave open in 1950 in connection with the starting bang of Teekkari Village, a skull was found. The skull evidently smells of littu. This inevitably proves that person was a teekkari.)`"
