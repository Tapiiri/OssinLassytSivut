Some governmental elections were approaching, and the National Coalition Party held its summer negotiation day in Teekkari Village. Their election motto was at that time: "Jo on aika panna maan asiat kuntoon"\*. This text was adorning the meeting hall's back wall. In front of it sat, among other things, chairman Jussi Saukkonen and the party secretary. Then a magazine photographer came, took a picture and left. When I happened to go to this hall as a part of my inspection route the next day, there was an unusual burst of joy and laughter. The previous day's newspaper picture was displayed: chairman Saukkonen and the party secretary sat there and looked important. From behind, the text "MAAN SIAT" is visible. Coincidentally, Saukkonen's head covered the A-letter of the word "asiat."

\*Translator's remark: "It is already the time to put the country's affairs in condition."
