# 114. Dipoli's First T-evening, Little Christmas Party, And New Year

When Dipoli was then completed and began operations in fall 1966, it initially attracted enormous attention. Two thousand eight hundred tickets were sold to the first T-evening. On Sundays, thousands of people visited the lunch tables of this mammoth of a restaurant. The first Little Christmas Time has also been left ineradicable in my mind. One Saturday night, there spent exactly 16 different groups their own Little Christmas at Dipoli at the same time. Each of the four great halls had 250-400 people's magnitude knees-up and in smaller halls and cabinets, correspondingly smaller. Servi's Maija, indeed with her children, had to rush between the halls and the kitchen to ensure that all the groups received the ordered hams and rosolli salads in time. Admittedly, a hundred or so extra waiters were hired to help Maija.

As the first New Year's Eve arrived, the building was as if hammered. We roasted an entire bull in the fireplace at the lobby, and even the dessert was in correspondence with the scale of Dipoli. It was a cake over one meter in diameter, which at midnight was pushed to the hall guarded by master chef Lappi. Twelve strokes were heard, and the top of the cake flew off. An Egyptian belly dancer Zeida Amara emerged, accompanied by a dance group of three women. Serviceman Teuvo Turunen simultaneously pumped a couple of liters of wonderful perfume to the air ducts leading to the hall to enhance the atmosphere. After the belly dancing performance, Lappi then rationed the cake to several guests. Everyone stood amazed at the wonderful taste of the cake. At the same time, those who impatiently rushed to scoop some cream from the top of the cake received the letdown of their lives. They filled their mouths with the so-called äpy-foam, which was made of soap. Only a particular part of the cake was made of the real stuff. By the way, one of the dancing girls to jump out of the cake was Kaarina Tuunanen, so if you meet her, why don't you ask her for any details on the matter."
