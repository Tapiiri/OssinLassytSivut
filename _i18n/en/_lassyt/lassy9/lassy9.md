By the joint efforts of YTHS\* and the TKY, Otaniemi's Health Center was established back in the day into a building of Teekkari Village. Erkki Laurila was TKK's representative in the inauguration ceremony (current academician). On behalf of YTHS, its chairman, MSc Techn Urpo Ratia, and the chief doctor Kari Savonen were present. This event did not take place without a "Teekkari Village-like" incident. When professor Laurila signed the station's foundation charter, the ceremonial place's front door (TKY 5's fireplace room) opened. Two young men in pure white and really cleanliness shining tights with black bowler hats on their head, sunglasses on eyes, and canes in their hands. The painted black mustaches under the nose emphasized the appearance of the gentlemen. After seeing the prominent festive people standing in the room, they stiffened at the door, looking around for a moment in amazement. After that, one of them said: "Brother, I feel like we have not been invited to this event, whatever it then may be." They raised their bowler hats with dignity, turned, and left. It remained a mystery who they were and from where to where they were going.
