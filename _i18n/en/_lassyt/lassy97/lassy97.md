# 97. Servin Maija nudges a vagabond in the right direction
When the Otaniemi chapel was being built, there was this worker among the crew, who was a known vagabond and was regularly seen in the neighbourhood “slightly out of composure”. Servin Maija, who in addition to looking after stray cats was a compassionate friend of the meek and broken, took the lad under her motherly wing preaching him of redemption. And lo, when the chapel was complete and the rest of the crew had left, Maija's ward arrived in the most stylish clothing, his face emanating with health and joy with a massive bouquet of roses in hand. He handed them over to Maija thanking her for lifting him up on his feet from the “sin and filth”. With utmost happiness he proclaimed to have met the woman of his life to whom he then hurried leaving Maija and myself happy yet confused about such enormous change. A couple months passed and the same man dragged himself to Maija’s place in his former worn out garb reeking of liquor. “She wasn’t worth it”, he announced and trudged off, who knows where.
