# 159. Phases Of VAPPU ROWDINESS-LITTUS

The fate of all littus is not even known. However, I recall that a littu fell to the ground already before Otakaari - if not to it. However, the recond seems to be taken place in 1977.  In that year, a littu traveled near the eastern border near Imatra. Here are some well-known sites of littu discoveries (no reports have been received from the behind of eastern border and the Gulf of Finland):

- 1975 Rääkkylä, Ihalansalmi
- 1977 Imatra
- 1978 City Garden of Helsinki
- 1980 Radio Helsinki, Keimola, Vantaa
- 1982 Heinola rural community, Paasa
- 1983 Pyhtää, Länsikylä
- 1984 Römsörn Tammisaari 1
- 1985 Hirsijärvi, Loppi

This year's happy mushroomer, although late, was Jorma Höök from Riihimäki. He was at least left a good taste in his mouth. Jorma's comment on the flavor: "Good. Probably apple bubble. Did the guess hit close, Ossi?". Attached is the story of the discovery of that littu. The finder's imagination seems to be of lively quality.

*I am still writing here late in the evening, good taste in my mouth, a letter to you, dear teekkaris. Thanks for a good vappu's welcome, albeit a little late. (Which year?) I found the first message-in-bottle during my mushroom trip from the forest of mother-in-law 28.8.85 at 18.40. At that moment, I noticed a light brown "rag" on a spruce branch and on the ground a liquor bottle. My first thought was, "Some berry pickers have gone really wild as even the pantyhose have been thrown away." A closer look, however, that there were remnants of a balloon. After that, I found your greeting.*

*Unfortunately, the card has gotten damp. Or maybe a deer has licked the card. However, I wasn't able to figure out the picture.*

*Thanks anyway. Hopefully, the same kind of balloons will fall into the same forest in the future.*

*I wish you teekkari committee all the best,

*P.S. I am going to the woods to observe for balloons.*"
