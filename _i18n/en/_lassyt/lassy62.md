# 62. Paavo Nurmi Statue On The Wasa Ship

Simili (Sitsimiesliitto\*) has the immortal honor for bringing "surprising extra color" for lifting the Wasa ship, which had been on the sea bed for two centuries. For the beginning of this story, it must be told that to finance Otaniemi Sports Hall, bronze Paavo Nurmi statues were sold. TKY also handled this charity trade, and there were hundreds of statues in our stock. Similists took one of these to their suitcase and traveled to Stockholm. From somewhere, they hired a frog diver, who before the night of the lift deftly dived the Paavo statue among the other rubbish on the deck of the wreck. When the venerable Wasa then dignifiedly surfaced, accompanied by the people's Heja shouts, there was a slight surprise when Paavo also raised his head above the water's surface.
