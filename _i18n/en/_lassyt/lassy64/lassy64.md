# 64. The TKY Board Visits The Atomic Cave And A Bum

When the board of TKY once again changed and completed its first round of familiarisation in Otaniemi, we also dragged them to a vast bomb shelter, which was under construction. It is roughly under Dipoli, and several entrances lead to it from different sides. The then chairman of the student union at that time was MSc. Techn. Väinö Nurmimaa, who was also with us on tour. At that time, the jäynä was that the marketing manager, Jaakko Saarinen, disguised himself as at least 96% bum. He was waiting in the cave with his denatured alcohol bottles and other props. Our bum was delighted and uttered verbosely us welcome to his cheap but more spacious hut. He offered his stuff\* which smelled disgusting and genuinely growled. When we left the cave, our bum joined our party's tail and came after us to Rantasauna. Jaska Saarinen's performance was so perfect that even Nurmimaa was fooled; he called me aside and demanded to take that scoundrel away in a stern tone of voice. When Jaska, after this show stage, came as "a civilian" among others on the benches of the sauna, Väiski did not want to believe that it was the same person.

A similar play was performed in the Atomic Cave yet for the second time. That's when we fooled the whole highest police leadership of the Nordic countries. But that has to be told later separately. And there performed like a star, a completely different person.

\*Translator's remark: the original Finnish word is 'puli.'"
