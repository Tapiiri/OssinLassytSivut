The thought of transferring Helsinki University of Technology and the student apartment area, which would be built close to it, woke immediately after the war years. Then, on the other hand, Campus-ideas from the USA came. On the other hand, the number of students grew significantly. Also, the war had damaged the University of the Technology building. The Grand Old Man of town planning and urban planning, Otto-Iivari Meruman, then presented based on some preliminary surveys the transferring of the whole University from Helsinki's central city area. The apartment situation of teekkaris had become worse annually due to the growing amount of students. The student union had only 80 apartment places in Teekkarila, located next to Poli, completed in 1930. It was also hard to get an apartment from elsewhere. In 1938, the State created the Student sports committee, which presented the construction of a student village as an ideal solution.

The thought of Teekkari Village was born at the end of 1945 at a meeting, which was held at professor Jussi Lappi-Seppälä's home. There were developing the idea MSc Techns Ilmari Harki and Koskiala and teekkari Paavo Koponen. Then, with the rest board of the Student Union, Koponen mobilized the whole teekkari nation into the project. So the year 1946's teekkari campaign raised money for war invalids and initial capital for Teekkari Village, too.

The place of location alternatives was mostly Otaniemi in Espoo rural community and Puotila in Helsinki. Different committees and the State's workgroups thought about it for their own time relative to both TKK [Teknillinen Korkeakoulu, Helsinki University of Technology] and Teekkari Village. In 1948, the student union TKY took the thought to their own and appealed to public circles and public utilities to support the idea. The same year, the so-called Meurman committee had suggested purchasing Otaniemi for TKK, VTT (Valtion tutkimuskeskus VTT, the Research Centre of the State), and for teekkaris' usage. The transaction object was 108.5 hectares from the Hagalund mansion property, which Kansallis-Osake-Pankki owned. The purchase price would be 115.5 million Finnish Marks (108 Finnish Marks/1 square meter) of the money of that time. With uncompromising efforts and handling the matters "by the kitchen," the appropriation money, which enabled the transaction, was received at the very end of 1948 to be included in the government revenue and expenditure budget.

Once the location and land acquisition had been determined, teekkaris an extensive campaign to raise funds for the construction. In this work, teekkaris showed their ability and skills beyond all expectations. During the years 1949-1951 had to be organized with a wide variety of imaginative operations. In Kukanpäivä (literally "Flower's Day," also known as Floora's Day) in 1952, the Village could be consecrated to its purpose. Teekkaris organized at least about 30 million Finnish Marks' lottery in 1949, broad dancing activities around Finland, purchasing the U.S. military's surplus stock and selling forward, Nylon socks and first post-war oranges importing, profitable fundraising among pharmacists, by acquiring Vienna Philharmonic to orchestrate for the Village and last but not least the war-damaged Soviet Union's embassy building's deconstruction, cleaning of the bricks and transporting to Otaniemi for building material. The total amount of the bricks was 800 000 pieces. But after many eventful twists, the project succeeded well. The Kukanpäivä festival, during which Teekkari Village was inaugurated, was commented on by Helsingin Sanomat as follows:

"With a real teekkari bang, followed by a crackly fireworks display and the start of a fire not included in the program, the result of teekkaris' dream was inaugurated yesterday. This took place in 750 students' Teekkari Village in Otaniemi. In the inaugurations were present, among other things, the village protectors president and Mrs. Paasikivi. The proportion of teekkaris has ended this time. The University of Technology now expects laboratories and other buildings to rise around the Village by the State. After that, the University as a whole will move to Otaniemi."

Although the University's move could be expected until the beginning of the following decades, it seemed teekkaris' enjoy their Village well with their customs and escapades. Especially than the village leader was 1952-1969 Ossi Törrönen, teekkari honoris causa also himself.

### The administration of Teekkari Village

From the beginning to the year 1971 end, the administration was managed by each house's Castle Warden and the representative body consisting of the Castle Wardens. In the so-called Old Village's buildings, Jämeräntaival 3, 5, and 7, each castle's tower was governed by Hornhead. In each 6-12 inhabitant's dormitory was also a dormitory elder. All in all, there are 138 dormitories in the current "bachelor village." Bachelor village means Jämeräntaipale's buildings as the difference from the Family Village. Many move to Family Village already during their studying times via the chapel, located between the villages.

Castle Wardens were chosen in each house's house meeting. The Castle Warden Host then chose the Main Castle Warden among themselves. The Castle Warden Host's task was to select the residents according to the given instructions, maintain order, and organize celebrations and jäynäs. Also, in general, it was Castle Warden Host's task to act as advocates and representatives of the residents' opinion. Student union TKY's board and representative council took care of financial decisions and financial responsibilities.

From the beginning of 1972, perhaps the most open-minded and far-reaching resident democracy in all of Finland was created in the Village. Every year, all the villagers who have turned 16 elected a 15-member Residents' Council, which approves the village budget and financial statements and decides on the general guidelines and principles of the Village's activities. Residents' Council elects the Village Council as a preparatory body for its decisions and as a "train driver" for practical activities. The Village Council consists of 4-6 teekkaris and one employee representative. Due to the regulation-based community's status, TKY's representative Council will still have to approve the budget and financial statements and the housing regulations adopted by the Residents' Council rules of principle. Residents have been relatively happy with self-government, although recent discussion of the appropriateness of two bodies of resident democracy, the Residents' Council and the Village Council, in the long run. The Castle Wardens and dormitory elders under the previous system still serve as an aid to the Village Council in familiarizing, e.g., new residents to the customs of the house and taking care of the order in their house.
