When it comes to Teekkari Village, technology also has its fingers at play\* in everyday life. The theoretical knowledge learned at the University must absolutely be tested also in practice. A couple of boring testimonies. Many of those who have lived in the village probably remember the dish ohm sausage. In its making, the latest advances in science were explicitly utilized. The preparation instructions were as follows: take a certain length of a piece of link sausage. Forks are inserted at each size through the whole length of the spikes. Electrical wires are connected to the forks, and the wires are connected to the room's wall socket. The result: sausage boils happily in a few moments - or the fuse burns. Should the fuse burn, the sausage has been too short. Take a new, longer piece, and repeat the experiment. This is continued until experimentally, a proper length for the sausage has been found. The ozone odor from the sausage can be compensated with white pepper and mustard.
