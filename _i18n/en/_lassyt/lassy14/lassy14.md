# 14. With The Trojan Car During The General Strike

During the General strike, when the buses did not run either, Otaniemi's traffic was handled mainly by the Village's small van branded Trojan. We probably had got from the strike committee some traffic permit. So "Troika" then drove night and day almost uninterrupted between the city and the Village. Every time the number of passengers was nearly unbelievable. The car was roughly the size class of the current little Fiat or Opel. Still, I would argue that, on average, it ran about a dozen teekkaris during that strike at a time. To guarantee the fuel supply for this "vital" transport, a gas station that was en route was infiltrated. The infiltration was done by infiltrating some teekkaris as strike guards into a gas station who always let the Troika go to the gage when it was full of passengers. The drives in Troika were always teekkaris, as Teekkari's Car Club (TAK\*) owned it.

\*Translator's remark: TAK stands for "Teekkarien Autokerho"."
