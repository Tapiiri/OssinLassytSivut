Teekkari Village's very own publication Otahuuto\*, was printed only on a regular copy machine in the early years. It was made with the Castle Warden Host's own activity. It was a cultural publication, which was distributed outside the doors of dormitories mail racks. A mail rack was called a "lötterö." Once upon a time, police college students had to be awarded "full marks" when they published with their own copy machine printed Otahuuto. They delivered it to Village's lötterös just before the right Otahuuto came. The villagers were entirely fooled, as the magazine's end had police students' "own perceptions" of teekkaris. It was a really praiseworthy and time-consuming jäynä from the police students.

\*Translator's remark: \*Otahuuto\* literally stands for "\*Otashout\*.""
