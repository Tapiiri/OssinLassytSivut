# 136. Parties At Servi Without Permission - I End Up To Magistrate's Court

When Teekkari Village celebrated its honorable five years on 13.5.1955, a relevant celebration was held at Servin Mökki. In the festivities, those brave teekkari generations reminisced with affections that in the late 40s took real action to ease the student house misery in our good Helsinki. It should be noted that this five-year celebration started only after the official opening hours of Servi at 21.00, and the liquor really played no part in the matter. Even then, there was no license yet to serve alcohol. Servin Mökki was packed to the brim of teekkaris, their missuses, or other female friends. Polytechnic Choir, Polytechnic Orchestra, and the teekkari fire brigade RWBK took care of the artistic part as a team. As the evening dimmed, the entertainment speed showed a steady increase. That's when the main door of Servin Mökki opened suddenly, and two uniformed "sheriffs" with Smith & Wessons on their belts pushed in. I happened at the time to stand in the hallway.
"WHO IS THE ORGANIZER OF THIS ASSEMBLY" was a laconic line of the authorities. At first, it was just amusing; I asked the gentlemen constables to put on a hat, belts, and a gun on a coat of arms and engage in joys. But - then it turned out that they were sent by the lensmann of Espoo district on official duty to close the event, for which the relevant celebration permit had not been applied. Until that moment, in good faith, I thought that the estate owner could come to his own house whenever one wants without any special ceremonies. TKY owned Servin Mökki, and its members were inside. Lensmann, however, interpreted the law in such a way because a restaurant is a so-called "public entertainment estate." This means that not even its owners can not gather there more than 20 persons' sized group. Twenty-one people were, according to his interpretation, an assembly. "To avoid unnecessary shooting and property damage," we ended the celebration according to the order, six guys grabbed the piano, and it was carried to TKY 3's lower lobby. To there, the officers had no business to come because - as I vigorously informed them - it was teekkaris' apartment. An unauthorized intrusion would result in charge of violating domestic peace, for example, to uniformed police officers unless they had a formal and written search warrant. Well, they did not have one, so they left in the direction of the office of Espoo lensmann, Kauniainen\*, and we continued our interrupted family celebration.

After a while, I received a subpoena to the Espoo district court, as I registered to the officers mentioned above as the festival's organizer (i.e., the assembly). As a first-time criminal, the verdict was to pay the neglected festival permit's stamp duty to State as a threefold sum. The alternative was to spend ten days in prison.

Considering the mitigating circumstances and the livelihood difficulties of my large family
during my possible imprisonment, the TKY board decided to pay the fine to the student union
funds. The amount of the penalty was 93 Finnish Marks.

\*Translator's remark: At one point, some of the Espoo authorities' offices were not located in Espoo but the city of Kauniainen."
