29.9.1966 Inauguration of Dipoli.

It took seven years and 18 days, according to the above and insensitive timetable, to birth Dipoli. Thus, no one can claim that it was rushed and gesticulated. Large and remarkable was the group of teekkaris, engineers, architects, various field experts, and authorities who were involved in the project in one way or another. The work was done in a way as a TKY's own work. It was done under the supervision of Rakennusinsinööriurakoitsijat ry, who were involved in the project without any compensation, whose members formed the construction works committee and monitored the construction works. However, as many as thirty (30) subcontractors were needed before everything was ready. And a lot of money was also required.  A total of 10.6 million marks of that time. It was collected as follows: loans from financial institutions 5.7 million marks; loans from the government 1.0 million marks; grand from the government 1.0 million marks; fundraising 1.5 million marks, own funds 1.4 million marks. It must be said in particular of the collections that 90% of the teekkaris donated to DIPOLI their 1 DAY SALARY from their training salary in the summer of 1961. In 1962, 3296 engineers and architects did the same. Also, the financial statement raising, which was targeted at our country's business life, produced good results.

And so came the moment of Dipoli on 29.9.1966. On that day, yours truly had the memorable task of honor to drive with a battery-powered forklift, dressed in a tailcoat, along with and across the ballrooms.  TKY's chairman, MSc. Techn. Väinö Nurmimaa stood on the pallet of the forklift and welcomed the dignified inauguration gala people. There were about one thousand of them."
