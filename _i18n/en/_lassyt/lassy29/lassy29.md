# 29. Goats Of The Village: Maija And Teemu

In the spring of 1955, the teekkaris disappeared again to their practice jobs, each to their own workplace. Castle Warden Osmo Norvasto dragged from somewhere in the direction of Tampere an authentic live goat to comfort Servi's Maija. The goat immediately received the name Maija Siwiä. However, when she looked depressed and lonely, her spouse was soon obtained from Tapanila, a young white fur goat. It was named, without any doubt, Teemu. The Iltasanomat  magazine published this romance -  even with a photo with the text: "After the teekkaris have left Otaniemi for the summer, four-legged goats have now been acquired."

Teemu and Maija Siwiä then lived in Otaniemi for a couple of summers, bringing both joy and harm to tourists and congress crowds. In the winters, they were on Orion's farm in total care. In particular, Maija Siwiä had an unquenchable passion for participating in Servin Mökki's restaurant activities by stepping in with dignity with the rest of the festive people. Architect Kalle Vartola probably remembers when he was invited to perform at a prestigious event for the rest of his life. Kalle was then performing his brilliant solo performance (im tiefen Keller) on the podium in the middle of the hall. Then, Maija Siwiä stepped in with charmingly swinging hips and raised her slender foreclaws to the edge of the podium, grimaced, and said, "Bää." Kalle said he had great difficulty continuing his prestige solo there "in the deep basement" after this critique of Maija Siwiä."
