The voluntary work of felling at the Dipoli site was a miracle. A miracle because no people during its hustle and bustle a) died b) mutilated c) got shock d) lost one's fingers, or e) came hit on the head with a tree. Those hundreds who were present will probably remember the H-moment when five teekkaris with roaring chainsaws in their hands rushed to that jungle. After a few moments, the tree began to fall in all possible directions. Men ran in all possible cardinal points. The fallen trees were grabbed with the power of several dozen pairs of hands, and so those were dragged away. New trees fell all the time; the noise and blare were ear-deafening. This racket lasted for two hours, and during that time, the plot of Dipoli was shaved bald. The trees were pruned and cut and then assembled into pretty small stacks. The branches, in turn, were gathered into two considerable piles to the plot's central area. And then the whole bunch of teekkaris and several dozen Police College students to Servin MÃ¶kki for a voluntary work soup and voluntary work home-brew. The Finnish voluntary work spirit had once again shown its strength. Then, the construction on the Dipoli hill could begin."
