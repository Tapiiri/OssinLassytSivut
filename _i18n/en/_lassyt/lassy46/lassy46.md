# 46. Gardener Helling Donates 5,000 Flower Bulbs

In the series "Special Donations to Teekkarivillage," the gift of Gardener Helling's gift in a spring must absolutely be mentioned. Helling owned a commercial garden along Jorvas' road. So he called me and asked if he could donate some flower bulbs to teekkaris. I expressed my great joy at this and asked where I could pick up these flower bulbs. However, he promised to bring them here. I guess it was the very next morning when a large truck topped at the village road, and the driver inquired where he could unload his cargo. Gardener Helling's concept of "a few flower bulbs" meant at least 5,000 pieces. There was a truckload of paper bags that contained yellow daffodil bulbs. We had quite a task to plant the bulbs. There was even a little lawn everywhere; holes were punched using bars while other volunteer workers helped by putting the bulbs into holes. The village area was gorgeous that spring. Everywhere in possible and impossible places shone bright yellow daffodils. And partly shone yet also in the following summer. So many thanks to gardener Helling from years ago."
