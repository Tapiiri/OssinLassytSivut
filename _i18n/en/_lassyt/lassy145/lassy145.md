It is known that there are saunas of many kinds in our sweet Finland, about two million of them. Let it be explained in this context only one somewhat special exemplary.

Two decades ago, technology student Kalle-Heikki Narinen, drawing on architectural wisdom, entered my office without knocking. Kalle-Heikki stated that TY's\* summer trip to the Gulf of Finland with sand jaala\*\* is ahead again. He also told participants came up with an idea to design and construct such a sauna building that they would participate in that summer trip. The sauna would let provide hygienic refreshment to the heavy sailing. I asked Kalle-Heikki what time of the summer that trip begins, to which he replied laconically: "Tomorrow at 12.00". "Oh. Not until tomorrow", I answered with my matter-of-fact style. At the same time, I suggested and ordered the division labor that Kalle-Heikki would start to plan. I would carry out both construction and HVAC work accordingly. Despite the loose schedule, we implemented both the design and construction simultaneously as follows:

We took three (3) full-size rectangular-shaped hardboards. We sawed two (2) square-shaped plates in which the length of both sides was ingeniously the same as the height of the aforementioned plate. To these square plates were nailed to the side pine battens 2" x 2" and to other was made with a Stanley knife two incisions. That third incision was not made, but that spot became the hinge of the resulting sauna door.

We skimmed from the outdoor storage of Otaniemi Administrative Board an empty, used tar pitch barrel. We chiseled off the top end, punched some holes in two different horizontal planes. Then, we penetrated concrete reinforcement to act as a fire grate for both stone and fire chamber through those holes. At the last moment, Kalle-Heikki invented yet an ingenious idea. If we cut a square-shaped hole at the fire chamber spot, it will be easier to put the logs through it than to raise the burning hot stove up every time. The new sauna building with its equipment was completed in about 6 hours of huffing and puffing. To honor the ingenious designer, we named the building NARI-SAUNA. The future architect texted this name with his own hand on the outside wall of the sauna.

The plant was dragged to Pohjoisranta\*\*\* and assembled using wire nails on the deck of the sand jaala. The actual sauna ritual took place so that the stove was heated hot on the deck of the jaala. Next to the furnace was put a wooden bench to act as a sauna bench. The NARI-SAUNA was lifted on these.

When the summer excursionists then, in due course, returned home to Otaniemi, they shed plenty of praise on the excellency of NARI-SAUNA. There only one matter that was considered as an error.  The original idea was that brick stones would be placed under the sauna stove. The issue was that the bricks were forgotten in the hurry of departure to the shore. After unloading the sauna, the ship's skipper noticed ash burned round circle on his oak deck. He first planned to keelhaul the excursionists three times at the end of the rope. However, the skipper calmed down when he was proved that the burned circle would instead increase the value of the brigantine significantly. After all, it proved to posterity that the ship had transported in addition to sand the future vuorineuvoses\*\*\*\*, etc.

\*Translator's remark: "Students of technology." TY was a nation in TKY before TKY joined AYY in 2010.

\*\*Translator's remark: the word jaala means a smaller, one-, two- or three-masted gaffsail boat without gaff-topsails.

\*\*\*Translator's remark: Pohjoisranta is the harbor area of Kruununhaka, located in Helsinki's city center area.

\*\*\*\*Translator's remark: There is not, in 2020, an official translation for the vuorineuvos-title. The UNOFFICIAL translation is Mountain Counselor. The title is a Finnish honorary title granted by the President of Finland. It is granted to leading figures in commerce and industry."
