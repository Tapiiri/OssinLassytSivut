# 139. I Turned 60 On April 2, 1975. Irma Organizes Parties

On the wall of my bedroom hangs a frame of a timetable from the date 1.4.1975. And its birth entirely faults of teekkari h.c.\* Irma Henrikson. That night, five and a half years after I left Otaniemi, Irma had provoked to my birthday eve following: at 20.00, three police officers invaded my Tapiola apartment with Kauko Katila. I put my outerwear on and then to the police van.

At speed A to Luolamies, Dipoli. In the hall waited the earlier mentioned Irma, putting on my feet Finland's most enormous morning slippers with Teuvo Turunen. All the lights in the house were dark. I got a flashlight in my hand and an order to continue along the red carpet. That carpet was a 20 mm wide red tape on the floor. I followed the order, and I crawled along with the tape forward. It eventually led to the middle of Luolamies hall. When I got there, a vast singalong rang out: "Yö kuin sielu neekerin..."\*. When the singalong ended, all the lights came on and... the cave was full of former teekkaris from years 1952-1969, my then work colleagues, the consuls who are in charge of TKY and other teekkaris. Also, RWBK, a sufficient amount of police officers, even my own four adult puppies, and a couple of sons-in-law and daughters-in-law. All of these Irma had scraped together; without that, I had any idea of this. Irma had hermetically taped even my wife's mouth. The surprise was perfect for me and all the more exhilarating.

We ate, drank, and remembered the past. It was nice. And once again I got different gifts such as:

\* From the Luolamies -secret society, I received a hardwood (planed pine) tray, ensuring a sober lifestyle. A wooden bottle was permanently attached to the middle of the tray. 

\* From a former castle warden host a yo-yo, which material was birch. Diameter 265 mm. Thickness 100 mm. Rope? 10 mm. The length of the string 5,000 mm. Weight 4 000 grams. According to the handover speech, this supplemented the 399 yo-yo's arsenal I had previously received. With this older man's yo-yo, I can now play only from the balcony. Aas, Katila, and other police officers gave a half-meter wooden statue, which was announced to reminiscent of me also from other parts than just the head. The aforementioned Tintero (Antero Tiilikka), who was "licensing" at Riihimäki Glass Factory, brought a 5 kg glass crumb, the purpose of which I have still not figured out. TKY Board had taken a plaster print from my footprint, which is in front of Jämerä's Eye. That, too, is now hanging on my wall.

This feast of joy was then celebrated without interruption until I reached the age of 60. Thank you, Irma, for arranging all that for me.

\*Translator's remark: teekkari h.c. stands for Teekkari honoris causa and means honorary teekkari. It is a title given to only very distinguished non-teekkari members of teekkari society.

\*\*Translator's remark: part of the older version of Teekkarihymni."
