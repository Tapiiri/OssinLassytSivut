Teekkaris A and B had calculated a result for the following experiment: A went to the roof of TKY 5 and began to drain gasoline along a galvanized sheet metal rainwater pipe downwards. B waited at the lower end of the tube. As the gasoline began to drain from the lower end to the ground - he scratched a match. Wailing, swishing, a bang, and a collapse was heard, and the sheet metal pipe was torn at its joints between the second and third floor for 3 meters' distance. "Amazing accuracy," shouted B to A. Then they wandered to the village's office and paid Irma Henriksson 3 meters of rainwater pipe plus the installation costs. The validity of a theory had once again been proved in practice. And top of all that at a fairly reasonable price. The sheet metal pipe cost does not mean anything compared to that proof's value, which the experiment showed."
