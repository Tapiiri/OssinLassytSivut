When the Finnish technical products' first fair was once held in Hamburg, the organizer recruited Retuperä to perform at the opening. The next day's German dailies had praising statements of our products' high standards and the exhibition's success. However, one thing was much wondered in those articles. Why Finland sends an orchestra to such a prestigious event that is entirely unable to play. The art of Retuperä went entirely over the Germans' horizon. When Retuperä celebrated its roughly 35th anniversary in Dipoli, the announcer announced at the end of the concert that RWBK's management had decided to all present handsome bangs in honor of the celebration\*. When the delighted crowd started to move toward the bar counters, two loud bangs were heard outside the house.

\*Translator remark: the original word is 'paukku' can mean either an alcohol shot or a bang in this context. In this context, the crowd understood 'paukku' as an alcohol shot, while the RWBK management meant by 'paukku' bangs."
