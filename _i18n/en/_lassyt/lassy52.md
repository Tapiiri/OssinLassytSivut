# 52. Chapel's Baking Oven In Heavy Use. I Was Thought To Be Jesus

With the Guild of the Cross's trenchant efforts and as an ingenious creation of architect Heikki Sirèn, the famous Otaniemi chapel was brought about. My habit was to tell the guests that this chapel's money was partly achieved by playing it together. And this is the truth. The Guild of the Cross once opened Helsinki's first minigolf course along Mechelininkatu. And so, the money played there was used for the Otaniemi Chapel's construction. But that the chapel would provide more than just the nourishment of spirit for teekkaris, that they probably had not thought in advance. To prove this, it must be first mentioned that the village apartments had just ordinary cooking plates. Instead, to the club room of the chapel came also a baking oven. After the chapel had been in operation for some time, I noticed that teekkari's wives headed to the chapel more and more. Some wives went with "fruit baskets" (=perambulators) and some without. There they then sat in the club room socializing, making handicrafts, or shushing the little ones. The main thing was that it fizzled in the club room's kitchenette—there in the oven.

The wives of teekkaris had very soon invented this only baking oven of Ota-Onnela\*. When the husband arrived at dusk from the university, his better half came from the chapel with a wonderful fragrant roast with her. At this Otaniemi chapel, I was once promoted to a value immeasurable. It was summer, and we had many teekkaris, our driving school's\* teachers, and other guests. I recalled a group of women in Servin Mökki celebrating their private party, and I provoked our entire sauna team to run behind Servi's windows to fool around. There we then, behind Servi's French doors, jumped wearing only waist cloths, like centaurs. It was only when I realized that it may not be beneficial to the village's prestigious leader's career to jump in the middle of the night around the village, wearing just a waistcloth. So I detached from the crowd and ran, waistcloth fluttering back towards the sauna. To ensure that no one would see me, I chose the forest route that ran around just behind the chapel. There, leaning on the wall of the chapel, was a teekkari boy hugging his loved girl.\*\*\* When I suddenly appeared around the corner to the scene, the girl was terrified and shouted: "Lord Jesus." "No, it's Törrönen," I replied and continued with steady acceleration towards Rantasauna.

\*Translator's remark: Could be translated as "Ota-El Dorado." The name means the happy place of Otaniemi.

\*\*Translator's remark: refers to Teekkaris' Driving School [Teekkarien Autokoulu], located in Hietalahti, Helsinki.

\*\*\*Translator's remark: in the original Finnish version, this phrase contained the following words: "armaasti syleillen immyttinsä," which is from a work of a Finnish author, Aleksis Kivi."
