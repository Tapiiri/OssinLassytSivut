Yet another demonstration of ALKO’s absoluteness. This was sometime in the 50s, when the teekkaris of the board of TKY (Student Union of the Helsinki University of Technology) overspoke the hostess of Poli to borrow them some ten bottles of beer “After solemnly swearing to return them the following morning after the opening of the liquor store at Albertinkatu”. And so they did. At 10 am they returned an equal amount of identical bottles of beer to the hostess. All should have been well. but when a couple days later an inspector from ALKO made a visit, they were caught. That time bottles bought from restaurants had different caps compared to those bought from stores. Explanations were of no use. The amount of bottles matched. They contained the exact same beer - but had different caps. Due to extenuating circumstances and being pressed by the foreman the hostess received no punishment, but for a period of one month only milk was sold at Poli."
