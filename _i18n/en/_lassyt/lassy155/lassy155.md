As the teekkaris of that time surely remember, served the 7-time world champion of javelin throwing and Olympic champion Matti JÃ¤rvinen for several years as the Executive Director of the Otaniemi Sports Foundation. When DIPOLI was completed, I naturally invited also him to get acquainted with this enormous building. When we came to the top floor, where the partition walls were pulled aside, and all four halls were a single chain, Matti started to wonder. He asked, among other wondering, how long is the distance from the stage's back wall to the fireplace in the fourth hall. In the past, I had calculated it from the building plans and reported the truth, which is 82 meters. After having thought a moment, Javelin-Matti launched curtly: 'Dangit, I would not get the "stick" to fly from wall to wall without a new Olympics record." You see, he won a gold medal in Berlin in 1936 with a result of 77 m."
