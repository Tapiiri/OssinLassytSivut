For over 12 years I have tried in desperation to leave the 17 years I spent in Teekkari Village into the all engulfing dusk of forgetfulness.
 In the rush of the today I've attempted to forget the uncountable memories of Otaniemi, which as an unbroken tape return to my mind.
 But to no avail.
 I will not be rid of them.
 And for that reason, I will raise for one more attempt.
 I shall scribble those memories on paper.


I do not by any means seek to create any historical tome of "17 Years of Beginnings of Teekkari Village" etc.
 With confidence there will neither be a reference book: "Teekkari Jäynäs Over the Decades".
 I will now crudely simply list those quite mundane events, in which I happened to take part in or those of which I only got to hear about.
 I also know quite well, that I most certainly was not the one who knew, saw and heard all the things that happened in the Village.
 In that then near 1000 teekkari's community happened day to day and hour to hour huge amounts of pranking, mischievousness and jäynä-making, that came and went without so much as anyone registering it.
 Those all together in my mind formed the true teekkari spirit into Otaniemi.
 In that spirit I too enjoyed myself and it will inevitably be talked of when I meet adult residents of "Ota-paradise".


Perhpas for today's student it is somewhat interesting to get to know the "teekkari mentality" of those times.
 Were those times more efficient or preferrable than today - that I dare not claim.
 One, however, is certain.
 The beginnings of Otaniemi were characterized by the teekkaris' strong sense of togetherness - provincialism.
 Something truly unique had been brought to be - a Teekkari Village owned by the teekkaris themselves.
 People were proud of it.
 And gladly the "miracle" was again presented to countless groups and delegation, that from positively all corners of the world flowed towards Otaniemi.


When this list of tales now begins, let it also be made clear, that it will not try to be a chronological conveyor belt of my lässys, but is written exactly in the order as they have come to my mind.
 The stories are also mostly anonymoys, for with my bad memory it would have been impossible to dig up the names of the concerned.
 To the extent to which I have remember the names, I have also written them down.
 I hope, that none of them will be upset of my "revelations".
 And on the other hand, I hope that when reading these, as many teekkari or other person from those times as possible will go "Quite, that's exactly how it went".
 For the only thing, that I want to assure here, is that every story is real and happened the way I told it.
 Ask those who lived in Otaniemi then, if you don't believe.


I will now start by plagiarizing an even more famous Finnish writer: "'Tis tale of mine is of no frills".
 When I now begin to think back to the past of the village, the reader will no doubt soon come across one special trait.
 Regardless of the nature or the target or the teekkarijäynä they never were done cruel, violent, greatly intoxicated or drugged acts of disturbance or vandalism.
 They always hade a humoristic note to them, and the goal was to create surpising joy to oneself, the targets and anyone hearing of the matter later on.
 A true teekkarijäynä was - and probably still is - a bit mischievous, often on the border of decency, but never hardcore porn, politic taken seriously, or something deeply insulting.
 A lot of effort was seen to create a small unconventional joyous moment.
 Wooden axes however were tossed all the time "without causing lasting harm for anyone".
 Alcohol might indeed have "a certain part to the matter", but for things rarely turned to distastefulness.

Let the tale following of true events give credibility to my claims.
