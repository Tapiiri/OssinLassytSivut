Now I remember the time when the Prussian discipline prevailed for a month or so on Teekkari Village. It was June 1952, and the Olympics were coming. We sat with our then main castle warden, teekkari Olli Mykkänen, in our office at TKY 3's lower lobby when the door opened. An older, wholly bald but otherwise upright and agile gentleman entered from the mouth of which the following reply came out before the door behind him even closed: "My name is Lyytinen, I am retired colonel, the Olympic Committee has called to me this sports village's commandant, have a good day." Olli and I reared up and shook hands with the guest. The following Commandant Lyytinen's reply was immediately included: "Show me the accommodation plan for the village."

At this point of the story, it must be absolutely told that Olli Mykkänen was an active member of the Polytechnic Choir. He used to hum quietly whatever he was doing.

Well. I asked sir Colonel to sit at the office desk, tore up the village's accommodation maps, and tried to my best ability to explain the situation. Olli-host stood on the other side of the table and hummed something. To my meritorious stutter was abruptly and without any warning interrupted by Lyytinen's tight reply: "Wait a minute, do I hear right? Is someone humming?". Then the commandant turns his tight gaze towards Olli: "Are you humming? Listen, teekkari Myykkänen. When I am in the room, then there will not be humming there. Is it clear? Director Törrönen. Keep narrating."

I continued my work even more confusingly - and Olli no longer hummed. Otherwise, the three of us became best friends after the aforementioned initial surveys. The friendship continued long after the Games. The main reason for choosing Lyytinen to Otaniemi's sports village was that this infantry colonel, who had been in three wars, spoke Russian perfectly.

Another funny memory of Lyytinen has remained in my mind from the official opening ceremonies of the village. Whenever a new team arrived, we gathered in front of TKY III for a solemn welcome ceremony. When the Soviet's 660 men's team was with their pure white parade costumes on the ceremony field in row formation, held Sosial Counselor Akseli Kaskela on behalf of the Olympic Committee a welcoming address. National anthems were played, and the Soviet flag arose alongside other flags to its own flagpole. The final part of the event was when Commandant Lyytinen commanded in the Russian language the team to turn left (in military-style) and to march on pace. The team performed then a passing march, paced by the military band. I was standing right next to Lyytinen when Lyytinen whispered to me perhaps somewhat triumphantly: "It was, by the way, the first time when the boys of that country had just done as I commanded."

The Otaniemi summer congress phase then began from the Olympic Summer 1952. There were teekkaris who had a family and stayed in the village for the summer. These teekkaris with missuses and "larvas" were then harshly transferred to TKY 5.  This was done so that the third and fourth, and after completion, the second could also be rented. It is pointless to list these gatherings. There were really all sorts of things. Conditions here were deficient. There were only Servin Mökki and Sports Hall. But the need for gathering after the wars was enormous, so people settled for these relatively modest conditions. Then, when TKK's main building and Dipoli were completed, Otaniemi's "newer era" began. However, conference facilities and congress centers simultaneously began to appear elsewhere, so this sector's competition intensified. Buyers' markets came."
