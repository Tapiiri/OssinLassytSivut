When the municipality of Espoo turned 500 years, the council held its gala meeting at the Leppävaara vocational school. Our own man, Olavi Kanerva, was then the chairman of the council. We got a hint that at this solemn meeting, the council distributes grants for various good purposes. One of these would be teekkari activities in Otaniemi. So we dragged the always ready RWBK to the hallway of the meeting hall. When the council chairman hit the table with a mallet to confirm that TKY had been granted 10,000 Finnish Marks, the hall door was opened. Retuperä performed a lap of honor around the municipal councilors and played the melody "anchors up." The melody roared as a gesture of gratitude. However, a municipal councilor did not take kindly to this incident. This councilor asked immediately for the floor and remarked in Swedish, stating that the chairman cannot maintain order in the meeting hall. Who knows if that mention was written even to the minutes."
