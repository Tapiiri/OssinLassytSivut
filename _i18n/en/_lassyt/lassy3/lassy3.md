# 3. Inauguration Of Teekkari Village

After all, the first vappu of Teekkari Village passed. We began to prepare with rage for the inauguration festival of the village. The board of TKY had ordered the date to be 13.5.1952. The date was chosen because the starting bang of the construction had taken place 13.5.1950, and it had been planned that the village had a two-year completion time. The inauguration ceremony was held outside at the castle yard on TKY3, with President J.K. Paasikivi and his wife as guests of honor. Besides, hundreds of other "dignitaries" and the then "tassel people" were in corpore. The weather was springlike beautiful, and it felt like a big celebration was in the air anyway. The inauguration bang was loaded in advance to the beach reed field.

Well. Speeches were given, the Polytechnic Choir and Polytechnic Orchestra performed. Of course, RWBK (=Retuändas spritvillig brandkår, volunteer fire brigade)\* also came around the corner to play the newer French horn music. Then came the event's climax - forever teekkari, professor Bernhard Wuolle pressed the button. There was a massive bang from the reed field - the people cheered and clamped their hands. But after a while, people ran to the reed field. The blow had been so severe that the whole reed had started to burn. And let the truth now go down in the history that the then members of the RWBK were first on the scene. With their horns and helmets, they managed the fire to go out.

By the way, the herald teekkaris who had stood behind the Republic's president couple later said that they were anxious. The reason for this was the gradual sinking of Mrs. Alli Paasikivi's armchair legs deeper and deeper into the sand. Then, when that ceremony bang exploded, Alli was startled, insomuch that the chair's legs sank an inch again to the ground. The herald teekkaris were ready to catch Mrs. Paasikivi to their arms should have that chair tumble over to its back. However, that did not happen, and the celebration was happily ended."
