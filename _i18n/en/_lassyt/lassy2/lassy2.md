I arrived in Teekkari Village with my family (one missus + four children) fatefully just on Vappu eve. We had come from Vierum채ki Sports College, which I had served for more than six years. I served under the legendary Lieutenant Colonel K.E. Lev채l채hti's "Prussian" command most of that time. His motto was "Mens sana in corpore sano."

No wonder that the first night I spent with my family in Teekkari Village has been left in my mind ineradicably. Because it was really that vappu night with all the teekkariful special features. Not all special features may have followed that line of that Vierum채ki motto.

We temporarily lived in the 5 H part of the building in a dormitory. Under that dormitory, an unknown monotonous singer performed the less vappu-like song "I always stand at guard in the night alone." We never found out why he stood at guard in that specific dormitory, what or who did he guard, and why the guard shift really lasted for the whole vappu night. Then, in the morning, my dear wife that we shouldn't yet open our parcels urgently - "if this night shift patrol continues here also during other times than at vappu night." Well, it continued, but yes, those parcels were opened in the end."
