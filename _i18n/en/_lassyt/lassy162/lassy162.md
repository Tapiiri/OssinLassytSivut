- Servi's Maija (alias Hilkka Regner)
- Irma (alias Irma Henriksson)

Both Maija and Irma came to Teekkari Village in its inauguration year 1952. Maija has already retired, but Irma continues as before. What Maija and Irma have done for teekkaris over the past 35 years is useless to try to describe in words. And it is not necessary. For everyone who lived in Teekkari Village knows and remembers them and what their doings. Maija, however, mainly worked "behind the scenes" there in the kitchen of Servin MÃ¶kki. Later on, Maija worked in Dipoli's kitchen. Irma has been there more "on the stage" in the village office.

I won't ramble anymore about these two HONORARY TEEKKARIS, but I will attach two official photos, one of each."
