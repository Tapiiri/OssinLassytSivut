# 18. The Testing of Hoses Of Our Fire Truck Suihku-Siwiä

Now a few truths about our very own fire truck. Or rather, the fire truck of Retuperä. It was donated by Serlachius Oy to Retuperä back in the day. It was the venerable Ford, model T-1928. Handbrake, foot-operated gear change, and also equipped with a motor pump. It had faithfully served at the Manta factories until the transfer event, which was sometime in 1956. So when the board of TKY was having its meeting at the Rantasauna of Teekkari Village, I thought that now is an excellent opportunity to present the fire truck to mister ministers. So I drove in advance the car to the beach pier.
I put the inlet hose in the sea and piled it in front of the sauna window, burning stuff. So it was my firm intention also to show how efficient the fire truck still was. To enhance combustion, I had a canister of gasoline with me. When the moment for the introduction came, I doused that canister of gasoline on the campfire pile. Then I yelled out to the sauna, "could someone come to ignite the bonfire? I will start the engine". I should not have yelled that because a board member took the matches, ran naked next to the pile, and scratched. A swish was heard, and the guy faded into the sea of flame as the pile and two-three meters of surrounding environment ignited in an instant. A shriek was heard from the fire. Our board member with a Tarzan jump burst out of the flames jumping into the sea. Luckily the sea was a meter away. After he had swum to the dry land, he was investigated by the government and TKY board representatives. It was found out that the eyebrows and the front of the hair had scorched, but no actual burns were observed. Thanks to his quick reaction, he survived grilling. He discovered the functionality of the fire truck to be useful."
