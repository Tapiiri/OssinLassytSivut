There was the Dutch naval visit to Helsinki. The Navy Headquarters had ordered Otaniemi's Rantasauna to bathe the visiting navy officers in the traditional Finnish way. At the same time, there were very charming French ladies living in the village - they were the international congress participants. As the starting time of the sauna order approached on that beautiful summer day, our sauna hostess, Mrs. Määttänen, called to me. Määttänen franticly told me that she is unable to fence the sauna headland from others. I rushed to the beach in less than a unit of time - and there, those French ladies like seals in the sun along the sauna headland laid having dressed in fewer pieces of clothing. Although the sight caused some issues with breathing and the anguish of Greek mythology's Tantalos shook my body, I tried to explain that the sauna is reserved. There are now Dutch navy officers coming there, so the beach should be emptied. Mainly in sign language (I knew only two French words - 'mon' and 'cherie'), one of them described to me that the arrival of Dutch does not disturb them at all - in fact, it's downright interesting to meet them—et cetera. Then the Finnish Defence Force's bus arrived and from the bus began to come out of the bus both Finnish and Dutch blue jackets. At that point, the French women lost their courage, and merrily giggling, they frolicked into the bush. And so, an international crisis on the Finnish soil had been avoided."
