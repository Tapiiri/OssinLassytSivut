As it is well known, Flora's Day on May 13th is also the anniversary day of Teekkari Village. On 13.5.1950 was the moment of the initial bang. The bang was then annually reminisced with an outdoor celebration in the village. During such a festival, I happened to stand next to tens of members of the Polytechnic Choir. The choir majestically sang their ever-wonderful spring song: "Song ate skylark, spring starts to come." This ramble would not have formed if I had not happened to hear the version of that song by a couple of the choir members. They sang among the big choir their own special version: "Lauri ate a bread, s:t starts to come." \*. Well, try to stand there stable and with dignity in the anniversary celebration.

\*Translator's remark: the original song: "Laulu leivon soi, kevät alkaa tulla". The 'different' version: "Lauri leivän söi, p:ka alkaa tulla"."
