The following is a grousing poem by Ilpo V. Salmen, a castle warden of Teekkari Village's first Castle Warden Hosts, which is made into poem format\* of "summary of grousing the first period of residence 1951-1952". The topics of grousing haven't changed during the three decades, have they.

```
Sauna, hot water, window curtains
restaurant, bus, and hobby clubs
outsider residents - the price of childcare
the radiator is cold, and the surface wheezes.

Rent determination criteria or the magic of force of masses
Cable to pump motor and Olympia time
Rubber mats, household linen, use of wall surfaces
On Sundays displaying it to uncles and aunts

Sinks, basement bicycle shelter,
Four on call and the morning mail bringer
Flagpole, color tones, smells garbage chute
Which one is louder - fuksi or flute?

Table lamp, cash registers, amount of square meters
Private entrepreneur - right or wrong.
Old magazines, empty bottles, wardrobe design
In little use has been derivative, a moment of momentum.
```
P.S. I salvaged this poem from the spring 1952's last issue of Nyytiset.

\*Translator's remark: the original poem was made so that the first two rows and the last two rows rhymed with each other. For example the first two rows are as follows in Finnish: "Sauna, l√§mmin vesi, ikkunaverhot / ravintola, bussi ja harrastelukerhot".

\*\*Translator's remark: Nyytiset was a magazine that was published in Otaniemi. The Guild of Civil Engineers publishes today Ruutiset, which can be considered the successor of Nyytiset. Both are a wordplay of the Finnish word 'uutiset' (news)."
