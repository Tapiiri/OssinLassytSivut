# 90. I Got A Gold Watch From The Village's Teekkaris

When it had passed ten years since Teekkari Village's inauguration, it had to be celebrated appropriately in Servin Mökki. I sat with my wife without being aware of the coming surprise at the castle wardens' table. Then one of the Servi's French doors opened, and a living, geriatric horse hack stumbled in. I thought it was part of a surprise sketch until the then castle warden Jaakko Koski gave the shortest speech of his life. He said to me, "It is for you." When I approached the horse in amazement, I noticed a clock on its neck. And it was not an ordinary bell that hangs on every horse.

You see, this watch has three pointers, and it has the text "Omega automatic chronometer constellation." The watch was made of gold, and it had the text: "Ossi Törrönen 13 5.1962 The teekkaris of Otaniemi". A 43-page signature folder accompanied the villagers' surprise gift with the signatures of all the residents at the time. Page 1 starts with Hannu Eerola and Vesa Tutipää, and the last page ends with Jouko Arponen and Yrjö Tyllinen. As I write this, the watch is still on my wrist and still has excellent precision. It has been on my wrist continuously for 19 years, nine months, and 20 days. So thank you once again to all those involved in the watch jäynä after 19 years. If you ever need the right time, then ask me. Jerk even in the middle of the street if we happen to see each other. It would be nice to hear "what You have become.""
