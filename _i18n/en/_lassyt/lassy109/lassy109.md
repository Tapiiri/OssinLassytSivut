Speaking of animal things, when I was walking along the village's road with my Great Dane, I once heard one teekkari shouting in the window, "Hey boys, come see as Doora is taking Ossi out again." So that you know, I now have (-82) an even bigger dog coming to my household. Beware, teekkarit m-82. Training grounds will still be in Otaniemi."
