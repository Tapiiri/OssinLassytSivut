That old Finnish proverb really came to my mind when on 02.04.1990, I happened to turn 25 for the third time. Already twice before, the teekkaris of Otaniemi had taken part in my birthday with such joyful jäynäs and mass appearances that I really could no longer imagine a sequel to them. Before you continue reading this part, retake a look at my rambles 68 and 157. I will try to explain in those these earlier huge jäynäs.

And now, this third time. This, the 75th birthday of mine. Let me start by saying that I left Otaniemi "for other strange lands"\* in fall 1969, more than two decades ago. I really could not have imagined that today's teekkaris would undertake such a colossal brainstorming and implementation.  I now try to recall the details in retrospect in literal form. All of this without knowing me personally. I emphasize the word "I try." For that celebration, which began at 01.04.-90 at 23.50 and ended at 03.04.-90 at 01.30 was so multi-staged and surprising that some finesses might not be explained here. I sincerely hope that nothing worth mentioning is forgotten from this ramble. If something this kind of forgetting happens, I request a thousand times for forgiveness. This is certainly not what I meant. By plaguing a well-known legal text, I now want to start and "tell the truth and only the truth" without forgetting anything and adding nothing from my head.

And this is how it then was. On 01.04. at 23.50 began from the window below my apartment to sound quiet whispering, quiet talking, and other less ordinary night sounds. Then, precisely at 24.00, these sounds transformed into a co-presented Teekkarihymni, presented by Polytechnic Orchestra, Polytechnic Choir, Dominante, and RWBK's members. "Yö kuin sielu neekerin on pimiä." I got up, swayed under the emotional feelings to the balcony, looked down - and saw nothing. The night was at that point like a soul of Negro, that is pitch black. I tried using a flashlight to identify the signers below, but the lamp batteries had run out. I commanded these "troublemakers" to move immediately to my apartment for identification. I went to open the front door, and the whole herd toddled in goose march to my home. I calculated more than 20 of them, presenting all the above-mentioned musical teekkari corporations. I offered a warm hand to them, small littus for the willing, and then I coldly crammed them outside. I went back to my bed, being happy that the teekkaris of Otaniemi had remembered such a retired old man with this magnificent way. I really thought that the part of teekkaris ended with this song greeting. But.

Around 05.30, the doorbell rang. When I went to open it, there were teekkaris Timo Knuuttila and Mikko Lavanti standing, demanding me to dress and follow them. Well, what's with that. I dressed up and went out. Outside, a car waited, and the journey towards Otaniemi began. That's how it started but then continued via Otaniemi bridge towards Helsinki. Supposedly wanted to present me the birth city in the form of a small tour. When the trip headed towards Pasila and MTV studios, I started to "fear the worst." And that's what happened. First to be treated with a make-up artist. After a few minutes, I, along with teekkari Lavanti, was pushed into the studio straight to the "Huomenta Suomi"\*\* broadcast. There was no time for tuning. It was really elevating to wriggle in front of the camera and answer "ad hoc ex tempore" to the consciously unorthodox questions. Fortunately, I had to be on the spot just for five minutes. During that time, I desperately tried to defend the teekkari body against the journalists' lance attacks above.

After getting out of MTV and back to the car, the confusing dialogue between teekkari Knuuttila and teekkari Lavanti continued. Its only purpose seemed to shuffle yours truly's brain cells, which were already depleted by Altzheimer disease, to receive program continuation. At one point, they asked, among other things, had I ever ride a train from Helsinki to Otaniemi. When I answered this silly question naturally, "no," they said that now let's ride. And well, what could one do. We drove to Helsinki railway station, parked the car, and marched in the middle of the enormous crowd which was on their way to work to the large waiting room. To say something, the other teekkari noted that it seems to be a few minutes left for the departure of the Helsinki-Otaniemi -train, so he'll offer burgers. We went to the kiosk. Then behind the back, rushed two uniformed police officers. One of them roared with the hall-filling war voice: "Are you here again, s\*\*tana." The handcuffs clicked to my wrists, and so we went through the thousand-headed audience to the station's police's "reception suite."
I vaguely remember trying to entertain the audience with the Ostrobothnian folk song "AGAIN I AM  BEING TAKEN FROM PRISON TO PRISON." However, I did not get very far from the song's beginning when we were already at the police suite. The duty officer started to ask for personal information and social security number from me. After hearing my name, the duty officer apparently took the wanted list of the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service [SUPO, Suojelupoliisi]. The officers browsed it for a moment and shouted: "AHA, YOU ARE THAT TÖRRÖNEN. Constables. Take the detainee immediately, closely guarded, to SUPO's PREVENTIVE DETENTION.

I was escorted outdoors by the police and now changed the teekkaris' car into the police's official blue-and-white vehicle. Thus, in retrospect, it must be emphasized that this drive along Mannerheimintie to the prevention detention location at Messuhalli's basement was indeed the "safest" of my short life. On my wrists, handcuffs next to me in the back, sat a uniformed police officer vigilantly with at least a hundred kilograms of live weight. The other car driver kept glancing relentlessly from the rearview mirror that the journey went as planned. Arriving in the basement of the Messuhalli, I was rudely and "using milder and softer violence" pushed to prison cell number something. My handcuffs were removed, a bundle of striped prison clothes was thrown on the floor, and I was ordered to put on them immediately. I succumbed to my fate, changed clothes, and sat to wait. However, I did not sit in a chair because there were no loose objects in the booth. Only to the floor firmly attached "FAIENCE OF ARABIA." It took about ten minutes, the cell door opened, and a most charming FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, which I have encountered in my life, stepped in. She brought me an official lunch, which consisted of a 4x5 cm piece of crispbread without unnecessary additives and even as much as 1,5 cm3 of tap water in a drinking glass. Rapidly an aphorism of mine came to my mind. I used it on numerous occasions in the co-sitsit of Otaniemi teekkaris and Police College. "Kun ois edes naispoliiseja niin nais poliiseja / If there even were female police officers, I'd fuck police." My aphorism was of no help this time either, for that visiting sweetheart disappeared as silently as it had come. Once again, I was alone. Now I deliberately began making continuous noise, kicking the cell's iron door, clattering the bars of the hatch which was in the door. I also let actual pipe shouts from my mouth at a frequent pace and singing at maximum volume the ever-beautiful ballad: "ON TURMELLUT MUN ELÄMÄIN TALO NOUSEVAN AURINGON." I didn't get very far in my songs when the cell's door was slammed open, and two macho cops dragged me, still in prison clothes and handcuffs, to the police van. To prevent my escaping, the van was driven as far as the inner corridor. When I repeatedly asked, "what is this all about" I always got the same answer "that's what it is about."

In a moment, we were in front of the new courthouse in East Pasila. We had barely reached the hall of the second floor when the door of a courtroom opened. A new policeman came out of the door and shouted: "Accused Törrönen inside." For the second time during my short life, I now ended up in court because of Otaniemi teekkaris. From ramble number 136, you can verify that the first one happened already in 13.5.1955. That happened "in honor" of the 5th anniversary of Teekkari Village. But from this case, the honor was far away. As stated in the following indictment, the prosecutor thought I was pretty honorless. I could consider the only thing as my honor to be probably the first accused in this brand new courthouse with so many accusations. To the front door of the courtroom was attached the personal information regarding the case as follows:

The chairman declared the session has begun and verified my identity. Then the chairman ordered the following preliminary investigation minutes to be read: the prosecutor has demanded the punishment to Ossian Pellervo Törrönen, born in Helsinki on April 2, 1915:

```
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION MINUTES JRE / ÖÖ / 44987-144988 / 1952-90
Continued crime involving, which consists of
1) incitement to discrimination against an ethnic group
2) incitement to uproar and rebellion
3) Public endangering of the relations between Finland and foreign states and alone done breach of public order
4) shooting with a rubber sling in a public place
5) Leaving teekkaris in a helpless state

Törrönen has 01.05.1952-17.02.1970 in Espoo and a little elsewhere has made the teekkaris
with the rambles he has published, feel a sense of togetherness and teekkari spirit. This has manifested itself in arrogance towards other sections of the population and has also incited teekkaris in different years to celebrate and ruckus in their Wappu Rowdiness declaration. Besides, he has deliberately sought to endanger the relations between Finland and foreign countries. This includes, among other things, breaking the city's rules and regulations by climbing unnecessarily on the roof of a building in a densely built area. He has also sent propaganda on an aircraft outside of an approved aerodrome. This has been done without the permission of the police. He has distributed liquid called littu over the air with the apparent aim to cause havoc and chaos in the friendly states. Thus he has dangered the relations between Finland and foreign states. And further, Törrönen has fired with a rubber sling in Espoo along the ice of Laajalahti. Lastly, he has left teekkaris to a helpless state by leaving teekkaris after acting as the spiritual father of teekkaris. Törrönen's actions are eligible to demonstrate Törrönen's general disregard for the prohibitions of the law and orders. Therefore, I demand the most severe possible punishment for Törrönen. 

Törrönen has been over 15 but under 75 at the time of the acts.

The chairman now asked if the accused has anything to say to the court due to the read minutes. However, I was so paralyzed by the number of charges. I really didn't get a word out of my mouth. And now chairman unanimously stated that silence was an indication of admission and called two witnesses. And now, to my horror, the huge rage was added. These two witnesses were former teekkari and castle warden Aarno Teittinen and the former director of Ota-KOP\*\* and current teekkari h.c. Pertti Soini. Until now, I had considered both as my real friends who were filled with teekkari mentality. And now everything collapsed. They had come to court to testify. And how they did that; is best understood from the following copies of the original documents. 

Witness Aarno Teittinen:

Todlaus/A T/1990-04-02

WITNESS STATEMENT
IN THE TRIAL OF OSSI TÖRRÖNEN (TEEKKARI H.C.) ON APRIL 2, 1990 IN THE HELSINKI POLICE COURT

As a summoned witness to the court, I confirm with enthusiasm that I have witnessed the crimes listed in the prosecution indictment between September 1962 - May 1969. Having been instigated by the accused person, I have, without incomprehension, even participated in the mentioned crimes in some respects. I want, especially now, as I have the opportunity to do so, to point out an issue brought out in the indictment. That is the action of the accused concerning foreign powers. The indictment highlighted one side of the activities - sending the littus - but I suspect it was just a smokescreen. At the accused's instigation, the castle wardens of Teekkari Villages launched 30.4.1966 teekkari Teemu Tynkkynen by air to the east. We haven't heard of Tynkkynen ever since. We wondered why Tynkkynen had to be launched and whether he had any particular task. According to him, the accused give a letter, which was sealed in a brass envelope. Recent events in Eastern Europe suggest that the letter has been finally opened, the instructions have been read, and Tynkkynen has taken action.

As a witness, I hope that the court considers the punishment considering the facts and intentions I have mentioned above, either as aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and duly condemns the accused.

Witness Pertti Soini:

```
Honorable Mr. Chairman of the Court!

Unlike the customary case law, I have read the preliminary investigation minutes and the indictment of accused Ossian Pellervo Törrönen. These documents describe the severe nature of continued crimes.
I read the preliminary investigation minutes with slight horror, and I concluded that I must put my witness statement in literal form. This was done given the urgency of resolving the matter, the given charges, and considering the current preliminary investigation system. Also, the decision must be done in this session, and the demagog has to receive his prompt judgment. But, I thought long and hard, could this be possible? Is one teekkari h.c. able to do all those deeds?

I concluded that because the violations have been ongoing since 1952, it must be possible. In fact, I have known the accused since November 1960. In these nearly thirty years, I have not noticed that charged Törrönen would have changed his behavior for the better. The only external change has been the reduction of the dog, which takes him outdoors.

I must state that the accused Törrönen has committed all the violations found in the preliminary investigation minutes. Worst of all, I have had the knowledge that he has rejoiced and enjoyed all the deeds he did and he is accused of. This must, in my view, be regarded as an aggravating circumstance when considering a judgment. A likely piece of evidence of the guilt is that he has retained his youthful mentality. Besides, he is still always ready to do the deeds according to the indictment and instigate innocent teekkaris to racket and rebellion.

On a small positive note to point 5 of preliminary investigation minutes, I can say that he has now shown active repentance. He has done this by constantly acting as a consultant in various escapades. Besides, I think he has verified the charges to be true in his books: Rambles, page 4 (published in 1982) and Ossis's Better Rambles, page 6 (published in 1987). In both books, he states: "... Everything is true...". Therefore, I hope that these works may be attached to the evidence.

Honorable Mr. Chairman of the Court, I have nothing to add to my testimony. I do not ask for the witness's fee because the State's, TKY's, or accused's possible impecuniousness must not be an obstacle to a fair judgment, which takes place today.

Pertti Soini

After hearing these two unprecedently arrogant witness statements and no one in the court hall had anything to add, the chairman announced the police court would begin to consider the matter. The chairman ordered me, the witnesses, and outsiders to leave to the hallway. Not many minutes had passed when the courtroom opened for the last time for my part. We all went to the hall to listen to the court's decision, which the chairman read aloud while others stood listening to it. In its decision, the court found that all the charges against me had been proved. A JUDGMENT was then announced, which ordered me to be deported immediately. The chairman then hit the desk with a gavel; the police dragged me out of a separated convicts' door as the others presented in the hall, left by the waiting hall. The deportation order was followed IMMEDIATELY at a world record speed, as I was once again crammed into a police car. The police officer drove without unnecessarily caring about the speed limits straight to the Malmi airport. At least these two macho police officers showed a little bit of humanity by offering me a donut and a coffee on the second floor's cafeteria of the airport building. I can assure you that, in a way, it is rather difficult to drink coffee and eat a doughnut in handcuffs. At least everyone else in the cafeteria looked at my attempts with pity. Well, that coffee would have never been drunk entirely anyway. Soon an announcement came from the speakers: "An extra helicopter flight via Tallinn to Moscow will leave in front of the hall in 3 minutes." Helikopteripalvelu Oy's\*\*\* 5-seated aircraft was already awaiting, and its upper propeller was hissing disgustingly. I made my last deep bow to Fatherland when I went under that disgusting propel and then stepped on the plane. The police officers detached the handcuffs from my wrists only in the aircraft, ironically wishing with a smile, "Bon voyage." An unknown, sneaky-looking man in a black raincoat and an agent bag in his hand sat next to me.
The skipper of the aircraft then climbed on the front seat. After a while, we took off to air from that wooden platform on which the plane was parked. For a moment to my mind returned the words of a ballad by singer Jukka Kuoppamäki: "Kotimaa kun taakse jäi, mietin sitä mielessäin, mitä siitä kertoisin, etc."\*\*\*\* However, I would soon find something else to think about because at Suomenlinna at about the height of 1,200 feet that mysterious man who sat next to me, pulled out a huge pistol. The man pushed the gun to the pilot's neck and shouted the full half-turn demand in a few selected words. Due to the circumstances, the half-turn took place at an astonishing speed. So the new direction was over the Helsinki, Lauttasaari, and Hanasaari. Then the pilot made a skillful point landing to the greenery next to the Teekkari Village side of Otaniemi sports field.

After finding my great joy being again in my beloved Otaniemi, I did like the Pope of Rome - I kissed the land and those two charming teekkari girls, who ran to receive me. A hundred-headed teekkari assembly had appeared to the field's edge, and they sang the well-known congratulation song. After that, both the TKY board and THE VILLAGE BOARD said something. They evidently congratulated. I did not hear exactly, as the flight time whir was still ringing in my ears. After a while, I did not see anything. Inside an army-like tent's fireplace, which was in the wind, some smoke boxes were ignited. Then a heap of smoke covered the entire area. As I swayed among the smoke cloud towards Teekkari Village brought the teekkari girls, who were standing in line, the consolation I needed for this Dolorosaorosa" with kisses and hugs.

After arriving at the village center with the reception committee, I saw a giant portrait of myself in my short life. According to my visual estimate, it hung on the facade of the house TKY 6 and was a modest 6 x 4 meters. The picture was done as group work by the residents of the Bratislawa Youghurt bachelor dormitory. I found my dark curly hair in this giant portrait to have reached its full glory for the first time. Also, the BY's badge of merit can be seen shining on the front picture. They later handed me the precious metal original there at Rantasauna.

When my gaze then moved from that giant picture to the park, which was in front of the Servin Mökki's main door, I saw the Caveman Association's sharpest leadership standing there in corpore. As I approached them, they moved aside, revealing something in its nuttiness. It had just such a long section of a railway line that a real, perfect handcar could barely fit on the rails. A muscle-powered vehicle on which VR's work crews back in the day moved along the raids from A to B. However, one does not move even one centimeter with this track section's handcar because it has been welded forever on the rails. In his gift-giving speech, the tip man of the Cavemen, Nasku Salttu, appointed me as chief of the track section in front of me. He lowered to my head a handsome official hat, which displays this appointment. Then I took a closer look at this handcar and the track section. I noticed that a metal plaque had been attached to the handcar with the following text:

```
RESINAHKA
Teekkari h.c.
OSSI TÖRRÖNEN 75 v.
2.4.1990 L
```
Finally, we did an official inspection drive with Nasku Salttu on this new Teekkari Village vehicle. We stated: "It is attached to rails and will stay attached." But, despite our pumping, it did not move even for one millimeter.

After all the described events above, the teekkaris Knuuttila and Lavanti took me to my home door and announced to pick me up against in two hours, when my wife will come along. That's what also happened. We were guided to the great delight of Irma to that memorable dormitory 3 C 91-94, where our whole family lived from 1952 to 1959 (until the completion of the maintenance house). My wife and I reminisced for a moment of deep emotional touch and with longing those homely moments during which we were in contact with our children. We also recalled the time we spent with 54 kg weighed lap dog Grand Danois Sandora von Ottenheim. The dog was a horror to the hundred teekkaris of that time, who lived below us and heard the dog while studying. My wife liked this surprise visit. She had not visited there since our move. So thank you also on her behalf of this well-invented jäynä.

After that, the teekkaris Knuuttila and Lavanti dragged us back to the car and drove us to DIPOLI. And again, surprise, surprise. The legendary Servi's Maija and the main cold food preparer, Marjo Salmi. Servi's Maija (alias Hilkka Regner) worked in Smökki from its opening until the completion of Dipoli when she moved there. Marjo Salmi has been "the main calla" of Dipoli throughout its operation and will continue to do so. Maija, instead, has been retired already for some years.

We were now directed to Policabinet together with the representatives of the TKY board and the village board. And nor was it an ordinary lunch, as it had been designed by the hose master Leevi Letkutsalo of RWBK with his subordinates. Throughout the lunch, Retuperä played as a piece pusher the newer French horn music. The menu they created was texted on fiery red cardboard, and it was in front of each diner on the table. The text of the menu was as follows:

```
OTA-OSSI 75 YEARS
THE MENU OF THE HOSE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC
0013 ENTRE
1. MEAT/GALAAS - M UZ AC
2. WERD SHEEPBAR
3. DELICIOUS FOR EVERYONE
Leevi Letkutsalo
Hose master
All the musicians WILL BE ARRESTED
```
"The food was good, and there was enough of it. Likewise, of the newer French." With these words, I thanked the event organizers for it after the entire top management of DIPOLI OY had visited the cabinet with a congratulatory visit.

AND just now. After twelve (12) hours of warming up, I was informed that THE TIME HAS COME TO START THE ACTUAL BIRTHDAY RECEPTION at the Rantasauna. My wife Irma and I were escorted ceremonially there. Once I stated that my Irma number two, in other words, Henriksson, had organized everything to a T. There was really plenty to eat and drink. It was probably in particular 75 candles that burned on the tables and at the edge of the fireplace. In addition to numerous other delicacies, the festive table had teekkari cap-looking layered cakes. Some cakes had decorations that looked like my littu bottles. They really had gone through trouble for me.

And then it started. The unbroken pearl necklace line of congratulators glided in from the door hour after hour. The congratulators were my four children, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, my nine grandchildren, cousins with their families, friends, and acquaintances, war veteran brothers, and teekkaris for both past and present of four decades. And they came both as solos and as groups.

An uninterrupted flow hour after hour, it was such a "line" that you can not describe it with your tongue. My oldest friend was over 80 years of age. The youngest teekkari larva was minus two months, according to the mother's announcement. I then saw my youngest guest "with my own eyes" in early September at the age of two months at the village road in a baby carriage. According to the announcement of their mothers, this charming delegation of the four little ones represented the 62-head flock of teekkari larvae. By the way, that was the only delegation that agreed to join me in the circuit dance.

The other delegations just spoke and gave. They gave such beautiful gifts that the following list might seem to sound a self-praise of yours honestly even now. For it is part of such a stupendously inventive teekkarijäynä that it really has to be registered to teekkari history. I am afraid that I have forgotten a lot and that my yarn may be very imperfect, but let all my blunders be forgiven. After all, I have always been forgetful and now, besides, very old. You see, three times 25 is as much as 75.

```
THE LIST, IN OTHER WORDS, THE CATALOGUE OF EVENTS
At least the following individuals and groups stopped by, spoke, and gave

TKY chairman Mika Anttonen 
Suggested that I would get to choose as a gift from TKY one of the wood-burning stoves on display. I rejected that older model, which already on the sports field proved to be a very smoky model. The other one which I chose doesn't smoke a drop and works excellent at the summer cottage. And it even looks great.

Former castle wardens Matti Seppälä and Aarno Teittinen
Presented a hexametric poem of yours truly. The former one created the poem.

Former village teekkaris
Antero Tiilikka, now a doctor of engineering
Maunu Kauttu, now a city manager
Ensio Koskinen, now a sales director
During their studies, they formed a photography group called TI-Ka and even succeeded in Academic Photo Competitions. From them, I got a large-scale photo magnification of myself that they had taken two decades ago. I appear in it in two different outfits and positions. The photo was once made by exposing the same negative image twice, half the optics at a time.

Former chairman of TKY Väinö Vuorimaa, now a vuorineuvos
Gave, together with Vilho Lukkarinen, the book "WHEN TELEVISION CAME TO FINLAND," which explains the TES-TELEVISION OPERATIONS' HISTORY.

Former teekkari Pekka Löyttyniemi, now a city manager
Gave the work published by the City of Espoo: "Kuninkaantie," which explains the history of the Espoo part of the very old road between Viipuri and Turku.

Former an hourly wage operator of Teekkari Village's call center, now a vuorineuvos plus his wife, Pipsa
Gave to this retired old man an excellent and necessary electric massager. As far as I understood the speech of the vuorineuvos correctly, I can later charge the power consumption of the massage machine from the IVO.

The former active member of TAK, Antti Saarialho, now a vice-rector
On behalf of TKK, he handed over the valuable serigraphy work of Kauko Hämäläinen, "Alvar Aalto's totem".

Former chairman of TKY, Kalevi Kokkonen, now retired from the chief position of the Helsinki construction agency, brought a consignment of flowers on behalf of himself and his wife.

The delegation of STS/KAL, led by executive director Matti Kaario
brought an excellent pocket radio recorder, including a relaxation cassette, so that I could finally take it easy.

Former castle warden Reino Hanhinen
He is now hosting YIT and sent through his representative a videotape "Dugout Songs" made by the Veteli Male Choir. The videotape had been recorded on the Salpa front. These songs are familiar even though I never had to crawl at that war front as an air force man. Fortunately.

Teekkari h.c. Pertti soini, former director of OTA-KOP, now at Tapiola-KOP
After that incredible witness statement there in the court in the morning, how dared he to appear again. In addition to a warm hand, he also gave a KOP-like sauna robe and a löyly bucket. As security guards, however, he had Mrs. Tuula Karppinen and Ritva Seppälä from OTA-KOP.

Espoo War Veterans
The front patrol rushed out this time with relatively peaceful equipment, handing out flowers and reciting a poem.

Lions Club Tapiola
From the brethren, I received a promise instead that they will come to the cottage sometime in the summer to sing the Russian folk ballad: "While the lilacs bloom." As a more secure guarantee of this promise, they gave a trout of a lical bush, which at once took root to grow on the edge of my 3,000 m2 cattle farm.

"The flower girls" of the Village Office brought both flowers and hugs under Irma Henriksson's leadership. At the same time, property manager Markku Kivelä and maintenance master Veikko Karell stepped in without flowers. Instead, they had in their hands' excellent rubber boots. Those came handy in my berry, twig, and mushroom trips in the wilderness of Suomusjärvi.

Chief Engineer Matti V Hilska
With Matti, we reminisced on the construction of Dipoli and our joint introductory tour to the USA. As the chairman of the tradition committee of Koivisto residents of Helsinki, he gave me the history book, "Koivistolaiset 1939" [The Residents of Koivisto 1939], written by himself. ****

Master of Science in Technology Heino Leskelä
He served as the chairman of the "board" of the Dipoli construction committee. This special quality panel of experts was set up by the managers of the major construction companies. In this way, they provided the most excellent possible expertise for teekkaris when the second POLI, i.e., DIPOLI, was designed and constructed. It must be remembered that in this project of 53,000 cubic meters, there was no main contractor, but it was done as "own work." It was nice that Heino stopped by at the sauna. There would have been sufficiently more memories for a much longer meeting.

Erkko "Eko" Ingman
A friend from many years ago from Viinikka of Tampere rescued my future by donating 562 pages of "dictionary of tags." I really don't have to dig into my brain cells anymore when I ramble. I just open that dictionary.

Aila ja Aatos Isakainen
An architect couple from Porvoo, who are renovating Old Porvoo, brought a can of "honey they had collected at their own croft Apis mellifera Epilobium angustifolium." This means that I now have to start making a new batch of littu with a honey mix. The name for this new product could be "ISSAKAISLITTU ANGOSTIFOLIUM."

Architect "Tutsa" Tuulikki Kuhmonen
A truly active "otanist" in her own time hugged with flowers.
