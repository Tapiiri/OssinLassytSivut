# 69. Prestige Gifts I Have Received From Teekkaris

In this context, I can list some of the other quirks I have received in Otaniemi. All of these are stored in my home: 2.4.1960; when I turned 45, I received a combined head and clothes brush. A regular scrubbing brush and a soft car polishing mitten joined together with chains. The scrubbing brush is that clothes brush.

A three spiked iron garden cultivator. For me, a comb with a spike for every hair.

A topographic photograph of my face was taken by Masi Seppälä at TKK Land Surveying Department with contour lines.

A rocking horse and 2 toy pistols for order patrolling in Otaniemi.

A Black silk wig to be used at TKY's official social receptions.

An extensive collection of photographs of Teekkari Village's events glued to rigid 40 x 50 cm cardboards. The photos have been taken, and the collection was handed over to me by the village's photography group TI-KA-KO (Tintero. Kauttu. Koskinen).

The quirks I received from the Police College students I will tell you later. Those quirks are connected to the YYA events of Teekkari Village and the Police College."
