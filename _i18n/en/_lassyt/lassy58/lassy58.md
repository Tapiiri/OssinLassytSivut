In the series of "Jäynäspirited Secret Societies," the organization Cavemen must be absolutely mentioned. The Cavemen were born as a kind of parallel society to old Poli's Simili (Sitsimiesliitto). The organization got its name from architect Reima Pietilä's winning Dipoli-proposal "Cavemen's wedding march." The Cavemen took the task of transferring the real teekkari spirit to Dipoli with dignity once it was completed. A Caveman's father owned a vast building stone sculpture factory somewhere in the Turku region. As the stones were chiseled at the quarry, a man-size hole came to a granite boulder due to the whim of nature. The block was naturally unfit for further processing. However, our Caveman teekkari happened to come to the scene and declared the block being their own. At its lower end were drilled three deep holes, into which already in Turku steel bars had been soldered with cement. The bars came 20 cm visible from the stone. The corresponding three holes were then drilled in the middle of the Teekkari Village in bedrock. After several days, in the silence of the night, Cavemen dragged their hole stone in a large truck from Turku to Otaniemi. They deposited those three steel bars into those wholes, which were filled with cement gruel. In the morning, the villagers found an extraordinary sculpture next to the road, to their surprise."
