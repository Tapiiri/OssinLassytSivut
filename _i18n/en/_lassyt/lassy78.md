# 78. The First T-night At Dipoli. Koff Provided

In the first Dipoli's T-evening, on the other hand, the shots were actually offered\*. Koff's then sales director Nyman arrived and announced that Koff\*\* would provide every teekkari present a beer bottle. I said this good news into the microphone, and in less than a unit of time, teekkaris were in the lower lobby in a queue. They started to come back in a goose march from the second hall's side door after that. Me and director Nyman were at the door with a big beer battery\*\*\* and distributed beers. The caps of the bottles were kind of soft ones, which could be torn by hand. Thumbs in blood, we ripped caps off while the seemingly endless line dragged on between us in the hall. At one point, Nyman whispered to me laconically that now that teekkari, who wears a green jumper, bypassed our beer station for the fourth time. I comforted Newman, replying that it does not help to complain about it. That guy is apparently suffering from temporary memory loss. And so, we continued to tear the caps bravely to the end. Everyone got their tots, the most active several tots. And it nice. The restaurant bill was also nice looking, which we sent the next day to Koff, as they promised to provide the beer bottles. In a restaurant, it is not allowed to distribute anything past the official accounting. Even if it was your own product. Thanks again, Koff, for those T-night tots. Keep visiting us also in the future.

\*\*\*Translator's remark: a package that contains several bottles or cans of beer, in this context bottles."
