# 86. Sock Whirs And I Was Smashed

In the lower lobby of the resident building TKY 3, we organized the so-called "SOCK WHIRS." These were utterly unofficial and admission-free villager's informal events. So naturally, the Nurse College students were guests. The origin of the name Sock Whir came from our cleaning hostess Jenny Löfberg - she did not allow us to dance hard shoes on. So instead, the partygoers had to have extra wool socks.

During one such whir, there was once again some representation event in Rantasauna. I participated in this event together with the chairman of TKY and the members of TKY's board. After the event, I escorted the two gentlemen who lived in the Otaniemi Retuperä area to home. I was in the middle and a TKY member on each side, and we carried the gentlemen with the armpit hook grip. At this point, it must be said that during my entire stay in Otaniemi (17 years), coffee was my strongest stimulant. "For some other reason," the progression of us caused certain difficulties. Also, the door widths were not sufficiently wide enough when we got the idea to stop by at the three's sock whirs.

Then our humming "troika" continued its journey from TKY 3. At that point, a nurse teacher was present, "protecting the nurses from certain thoughts." She annoyedly said her aphorism: "YES, I NOW DO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS BEING LIVED HERE, WHEN THAT TÖRRÖNEN, TOO, IS IN THAT CONDITION.""
