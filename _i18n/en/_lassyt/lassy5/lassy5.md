In the winter of 1953, the first so-called pain sister competitions were held. The students of the Nurse College were invited to a jäynä spirited outdoors event. This first competition was held on the Munkkiniemi side of Laajalahti. In Otaniemi, a magnificent 6-7 meters high podium was built from steel pipes. It was towed to the shore of Munkkiniemi with a tractor and with a lot of noise. The competition was a kicksled competition between teekkaris and pain sisters on a circle-shaped track. Somehow miraculously, the nurses barely won the match. One fuksi stood on the podium throughout the Games and took pages from the desk calendar and tossed them to be carried away by the wind. He was the official "timekeeper" of the Games.

\*Translator's remark: 'kipusisko,' 'a pain sister,' was a term used in the 50s of nurses."
