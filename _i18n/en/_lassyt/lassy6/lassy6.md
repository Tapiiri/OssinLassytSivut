In the academic year 1953-1954, Jaska Koski served as one of the castle wardens. Later on, he served as Otagrandfather, an honorary position during the Old Village time for a distinguished MSc Techn. Jaska was an ardent teekkari who was busy to bring about the Representative Council of TKY\*. Until then, the highest teekkari body had been the general meeting of TY\*\*, which in turn appointed TKY's board for one year at a time. For some reason, I had come to bet with Jaska Koski in such a way that I promised to eat my fur cap if that council were to be set up. Well. The representative council was born as it was.
The moment came for me to pay the bet. I invited Jaska and other castle wardens to my apartment to announce that I will now eat that fur cap. The gentlemen arrived, and a handsome Koivisto-modelled\*\*\* brown fur cap was in the middle of the coffee table. "Take a man by his word and a cow by her horns," I said. I took a sharp knife and cut myself a piece of the hat, and ate. In no time, the guests also started to eat the had with a good appetite. After lengthy negotiations, I had managed to get the main confectionery master of Helsingin Meijeri\*\*\*\* excited about it. He made a layer cake of a fur hat model. It was really amazingly authentic looking.
