Once my aforementioned friend lensmann was taken in. It is so that the hotel restaurant can be opened as early as 5 am in the morning. On the first Vappu, I rightly asked lensmann on Vappueve for an extension until 5 am. He granted it in the printed form with stamps. On the Vappu day, I found Dipoli to be a hotel restaurant, and it was opened in the morning at 5 am. In other words, the present audience continued their festivities, however, without serving alcohol, which ended at Eve at 04:30 and began as serving beer on Vappu Day at 09.00. I had the perception that the majority of the crowd did not seem to notice that sober interval. They had such a good time. It probably was that festival, where Dipoli had apparently the world's first cocktail vending machine. In the lower lobby was a cubicle made of cardboard, which had two hand-going holes at the navel height. When one pushed from the hole inside a cocktail ticket and pushed the other hand to that other hole, the ticket was jerked from the hand. Then a stamp GIVEN appeared on the dough of palm - and to that empty hand, a goblet was then inserted, which contained the broth. The device operated properly without interferences."
