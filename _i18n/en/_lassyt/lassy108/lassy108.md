As we are so close to Servin MÃ¶kki, so many probably still remember what was Servi's Maija's liquor eye. Right. Whenever a yellow traffic light was lit on the cottage roof, there was a closed event in Servi in the evening, and others had no business there. And who remembers the celebration of the village in Servi, when Maija had promised to show how fast she was making food if the need demands. The end-of-age living horse hack was dragged from the main door into the hall. From the entrance hall, it was led to the kitchen. The door was closed; there were terrible noise and racket in the kitchen for a while. Maija's familiar roar was heard, the horse neighed, thumping and banging were also heard. Then everything fell silent, the kitchen door opened again and from there began to fly in a steady stream whole link sausages. It probably was a sausage-making world record in terms of speed. No hostess like Maija. None."
