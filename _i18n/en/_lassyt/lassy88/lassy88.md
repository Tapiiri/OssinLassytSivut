In the early years of Teekkari Village, a case happened after the central radio had been set up with voluntary work. A radio license inspector from the PLH\* without any warning. The inspector began their job logically from the lower dormitory of TKY 3A and progressed room by room in numerical order. As soon as the inspector left the dormitory, we immediately sent a bulletin via the central radio's information channel 3. In the bulletin, we asked to speed up the inspection and asked the residents to take out the radio receivers and the permits. A really lively bustle began in the village. The residents complied conscientiously with the bulletin and dragged their radios - into the attic and basement closets.

\*Translator's remark: PLH = Posti- ja lenn√§tinhallitus. A Finnish agency that was subject to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The agency was responsible for transacted the mail and communication-related activities."
