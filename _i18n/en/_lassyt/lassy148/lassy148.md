Sometime in the 60s, the world's geophysical year was celebrated. The celebration culminated in the World Congress of Geophysicists, which was held in Otaniemi. The congress was on August's side, so the nights were already dark. Hundreds of scientists from all over the world to here Otaniemi. The majority came already a couple of days before the opening. And now, a unique weather event took place under our conditions. During the whole night that preceded the opening day, in Uusimaa and especially above Helsinki, was a massive thunderstorm with raging rain, lightning, and rumbles. Lightning flashes occurred so frequently that those were recorded at the Ilmala weather station as an absolutely new Finnish record. It was amusing to watch how these scientists stood in groups outside, wondering what they saw. And believe it or not. The day after the ceremonial openings was the first lecture topic: DYNAMICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. "Our organized" demonstration presentations at night before probably remained in every congress guest's mind. As a result, Otaniemi received a large amount of extra goodwill. And that is always needed."
