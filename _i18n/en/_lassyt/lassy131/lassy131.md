# 131. Fish Rooster Cellar And Banjos Of Hinterland

Another artistic attempt was naming the Dipoli's beer cellar to Kalakukkokellari\* with typical 100% Finnish food. A trio of three teekkaris, Peräkylän Banjot\*\*. With national costumes on and the instruments were accordion, violin, and guitar. In the beginning, the success was better than good, judging by the enthusiasm the trio went to play to the cellar every night. The foreign audience enjoyed this typical and 100% Finnish art because I found out the "banjos" wandering to their homes in quite an emotional mood in the evenings. Yes, the harsh Finnish teekkari also gets emotional when they get compassion from foreign guests. By the way, the accordion player of the trio had heavy technical work almost every day as the piano keyboards during that night's home journey wanted to drop along the teekkariroad. And he then had to collect them back in the morning and glue them in place. This attempt lasted two summers, as the trio's distinguished folk musicians graduated miraculously no less than engineers with university degrees. They then disintegrated; A there, B here, and C somewhere. For 17 years, by the way, I noted an almost regular phenomenon. The more active he was in the other expenditures of TKY and Otaniemi, the more likely he would be removed from TKK's books as a graduated person. Well, there was a delay of one year or two for real activists.

\*Translator's remark: kalakukko is a food originally from the province of Savo. Kellari stands for the cellar.

\*\*Translator's remark: Peräkylän Banjot = Banjos of Hinterland"
