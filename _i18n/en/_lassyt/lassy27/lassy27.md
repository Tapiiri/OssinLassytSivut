The word tempaus\* is definitely invented by teekkaris. However, it is today used in all kinds of insignificant events as an advertising word. Yes, advertising always played a vital role in those legendary escapades. With advertisements, money was raised. The most prominent and most visible was the escapade procession around Helsinki. At best, there were several dozen advertisement cars were. Among these paid advertisement cars, some teekkaris' own jäynä cars were put with unorthodox thoughts. Here are a couple of examples.

In the middle of a truck stands a statue of the national poet J.L. Runeberg, made of cardboard. The statue's top is colored white by pigeons and seagulls - just like in Esplanade in Helsinki. On each side of the truck are the thoughts of that poet: "Mi onkaan tarkoitus tään elon raskaan .-Mä kohta hukkua on pulun...".\*\* At this point, the text maker had run out of paint.

At one time, there was a sensation about an escapade of the vicar of Kihniö. It turned out that the honored vicar had shown interested also physically in his confirmation glass girls. The case was built in such a way to the escapade car that the vicar stands at a lectern. The confirmation class girls sit opposite him at their desks. For the girl is the explanation 15 but not 17 years old. A motto banner is put around the car: "A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep - and if necessary, vice versa."
These escapade jäynäs, programs, and the whole Escapade's motives and goals were discussed in the utmost secrecy. First within the board of TKY and then within the framework of Escapade Headquarters, which was assigned by Jämeräbearded Engineer. When the motto, the headquarters' chiefs, and the objectives had been secretly clarified, the Escapade's proclamation took place with even greater ballyhoo and publicity. In particular, I remember the motto of the 1953 Escapade: "Tutki, tuumaa, tuota. Tutki tuumaa tuota."

\*Translator's remark: to ease the reader's understanding, the word 'tempaus' has been replaced with the word "escapade."

\*\*Translator's remark: a free translation: "What is meant by this rough life, I am about to drown to pigeons'...".

\*\*\*Translator's remark: the innuendo's point is in words "panee" and edestä. This latter means "for" but also "in front."

\*\*\*Translator's remark: the pun is based on the varied meaning of Finnish words. "Research, think, produce. Go through the thought.""
