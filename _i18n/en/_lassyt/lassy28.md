# 28. Welding A Cow To The Gate Of Council Of State

Now, let me tell you about a teekkari escapade, which was not implemented. However, its prevention for a while caused some agony to the chiefs of the Helsinki police. There was a time when there was frequent talk of the "cow trades"\* made by MPs and the government members. Teekkaris concluded that the then prime minister should be sent a greeting, highlighting the trade-offs' significant impact. So, from somewhere backwoods of the Espoo, a living cow with a hanging belly was borrowed. A wooden address plate was affixed to its neck. The plate had the following text: "To that and that [person] - for the great forerunner of trade-offs. With the utmost respect. Teekkaris."

The cow with its address was then welded with strong chains in the middle of the night to the Council of the State's strong iron gate. The job would have been done without harming the animal in any way, but so well that it would have been a challenging and time-consuming toil to the delight of the representatives of the public word and of the rest of the audience who came to the scene based on a tip-off. As usual, we told the police leadership in advance about the plan. They later said they had wrestled the real Jacob's wrestling\*\* to find a valid reason to prevent this attempt. Finally, one of them remembered an article from the City Of Helsinki's rules and regulations for his great relief. That article prohibits the transport of animals for slaughter in the city other than in closed cars. The prohibition was explicit. The cow was returned to the owner, and the welding nozzles remained cold. At least there was an attempt.

\*Translator's remark: trade-offs. The original word is "lehmänkauppa," which means the "cow trade." This idiom needs to be understood to understand the whole point of the escapade.

\*\*Translator's remark: refers to the Bible's Genesis' chapter 32, verses 23-33."
