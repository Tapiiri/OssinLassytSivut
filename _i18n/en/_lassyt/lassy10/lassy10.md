The undersigned came to Otaniemi in the spring of 1952, just before the start of the Helsinki Olympic Games. How the village was born, of that I have no personal experience. I have only heard stories of those countless and most diverse fundraising efforts carried out by teekkaris of that time to fund the Teekkari Village. All kinds of products from raisins to lipsticks to passenger cars were imported to the country and were sold. There were n+1 different charity events and escapades across the country. Construction material was begged from the homeland and even from the U.S. military stock surplus, fundraising campaigns were executed etc. Among other things, the names of private individuals and companies on the doors of building no. 3 were a token that each of them has donated at least 5.000 Finnish Marks of that time. The most notable event and the most publicized acquired, viewed from the Helsinki horizon, probably has been when the voluntary workforce students tore the Soviet Embassy building to the ground. The embassy was located opposite the Finnish Opera. The Soviet bombers destroyed said embassy when they thought it was the Presidential Palace. These bricks were dragged with great noise and fuss to Otaniemi, and the bricks were used to build the village."
