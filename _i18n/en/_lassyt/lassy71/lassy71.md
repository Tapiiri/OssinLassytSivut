Another legendary teekkari j채yn채 is probably a suitable continuation of this true story from the past; however, I can not prove this story genuine. At the same time, let it be an example of a j채yn채, which is already boiled too hard according to some people's opinion. According to the story, once a wild Bolterabend party was spent in Poli. There, according to the calculations, the bridegoom passed out for the last time as a bachelor. The wedding was to be held the following evening. The loyal friends then transported the victim to the Helsinki Central Railway station with a horse cab. The victim was taken to a standing train's sleeping car from which an entire sleeping cabin had been reserved. The bridegroom was stripped naked and was put to bed. The only thing left in the cabin were the train tickets and the sleeping cabin tickets. The clothes disappeared with the party at the Helsinki station before the train left. The following day, our bridegroom, who had hang-over, roughly wakened up by shaking - as the train approached Oulu station."
