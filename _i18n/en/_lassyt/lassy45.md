# 45. Canoe Relays On Floora's Day To Helsinki

When the previously mentioned Canadian canoe was brought to the village, we thought really hard about what we would do with it. Then someone came up with the idea that we could bring spring by it to our port city Helsinki. And began the series of spring relays, which always took place on the village's anniversary, on the 13th of May. Three persons fit into the canoe. Usually in it were TKY's and its board's chairmen and also the main castle warden. A topical greeting was written on parchment, then readout on the market square to the recipient. Our first message was received by mayor Eero Rydman and followed the Speakers of Parliament, the garrison commanders, police chiefs, bishops, and ministers. Photocopies of these greetings were initially on the wall of Servin Mökki, from which those were moved to Dipoli. Only once did the message paddlers have to land on the west side of Jätkäsaari. Earlier, the entire canoe overturned when it homeward-bound at the Klippan island.\* From there, the team was then dragged to land and reasonably medicated to withstand the rest of the journey. And they withstood well. While waiting for the canoe relay on the market square, the audience was entertained by Polytechnic Choir, sometimes by RWBK, sometimes by both.

And so spring came to our port city Helsinki every year.

\*Translator's remark: Klippan is the island between Kaivopuisto and Katajanokka."
