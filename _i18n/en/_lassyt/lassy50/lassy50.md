Another same kind of gentleman jäynä happened when the well-known teekkari activist Markku Arvilommi (in German: Arvid von Glommo) and also other residents of TKY 3 F horn's lower dormitory moved from Teekkari Village. In the moods of a sad night before departure, they unanimously decided that the dormitory hall's table, at which they had sat together for so many evenings and nights and discussed of when science, technology, women or of other arts when singing teekkari songs or listening to Markku's accordion solos, cannot be left to the hands of new residents. Who knows what kind of people those new residents will be. So they carried that table of memories out to nature on the beach, and it was burned to ashes. The arsonists reported to my office in the morning and asked for two weeks to clarify the matter. And then, after a couple of weeks, to that same dormitory appeared a new marble table which was extraordinarily much more magnificent than the burnt standard model."
