Our first major offensive operation was ruined by the engineers who had designed the police college, mostly the constructor. It probably can be said that "own dogs bite straight from the start." It happened to be the case that a small cottage from wood had been built next to the college building. To this cottage, the teachers of Police College demonstrated all sorts of burglary situations for students to solve. We decided to take part in the exercise and steal the whole cottage. We went to the cabin in the silence of one night with a large group, equipped with crowbars, iron bars, and axes. The transport equipment - Ferguson tractor with trailer - was standing by around the corner. The cottage was so small that, according to our calculations, it would have gone well away on the tractor platform. But, now, the master constructor had seen good to place during the concrete casting of incredibly thick, upward sticking steel bars. The cottage's 4" x 4" frame was installed to these steel bars with nuts, and the ends of the bars were still partially turned sideways above the nuts. We were not prepared for such resistance. While the night duty officer, who was at the lower lobby of the college, paid attention to our noise, we ordered our forces "to retreat in a good order from the place." I do not know the reason, but the Police College removed the cottage from the locality later on. I wonder if the fear of our new attempt would have been the reason for that."
