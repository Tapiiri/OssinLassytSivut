# 99. A British Teekkari Jäynä

As an indication of the jäynämindset of other countries' teekkaris, I will tell about a couple of cases that I know about.
There was a tradition in an English university of technology that as the fuksis' first semester approached its end, the older year's teekkaris did a real jäynä strike. The time of the jäynä strike was announced in advance precisely. During this time, the poor fuksis had really to be vigilant both at school and in dormitories. A fuksi came home to the dormitory in the evening and noticed that his room's door was just a little bit ajar. As a careful boy, he soon discovered that he had been set up with that ancient trap; a bucket of water had been placed on the top of the door, which was ajar. Exceptionally carefully, our hero pushed the door a millimeter by a millimeter open, and he managed to get a wide ap enough. He serpentined himself in and took the bucket of water carefully down. Then, maliciously smiling, he went to his washbasin and poured the contents of the bucket there - getting the entire amount of water into his pants, precisely at the fly. The jäynä was that the drain trap under the washbasin had been removed. The drain trap was replaced with an L-piece. This L-piece pointed straight into the victim's pants' strategic point, who would stand in front of the washbasin."
