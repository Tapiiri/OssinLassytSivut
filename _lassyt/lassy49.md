# 49. Teekkari Paid For The Window In Advance

Throughout the ages, teekkaris have been well-behaving gentlemen\* who immediately figure out the mess they have caused, whether those are of mental or material quality. At least once I recall, this kind of survey has taken place well in advance. When teekkari A's graduation party approached, A came to the village's office and asked Irma Henriksson how much the window panes of his room cost when installed in place. Irma looked at the prices in her price list with a well-known route asking how the windows had actually broken. To this, A answered nothing but paid the mentioned amount and received the receipt. Then that A's graduation party took place in his own room. Singing, playing, resentment, jingle, and pipe shouting. In addition to partygoers, the dormitory's horns, and the whole castle's residents were more or less delighted to be involved. But the villagers had already got used to and adapted to these kinds of phenomena. Fortunately, there was only one graduation event per teekkari, if at all. This new MSc. Techn.'s graduation party's climax was the moment when the window was broken into pieces for some reason. But knowing themselves and the guests, that teekkari had taken care of the matter's survey in advance - just to be sure.

\*Translator's remark: During Ossi's time, there were also female teekkaris but not as much as today. This is probably the reason why he concentrated his attention on the gentlemen's side."
