# 84. A Juridical Person = 3.5 Million Finnish Marks

All kinds of things happened during the various meetings and congresses in Otaniemi. The larger the congress, the earlier negotiations and preparations began. Often many years before the event. I was once contacted by a Czech professor who spoke German, and he requested a negotiation. I went to the agreed place in the Hotel Seurahuone in Helsinki, where this mentioned gentleman explained that a large international journalist congress was being planned for Otaniemi next year. I explained with my best ability the suitability of Otaniemi for the purpose in question. He had already visited in advance and explored Teekkari Village as the Sports Hall, where sessions could be held. After about an hour of general discussion, we had come so far that the Czech professor was ready to take a written preliminary agreement with me. Then I asked him what would be the responsible Finnish background organization, in other words, "juridical person." Then he surprised me by asking in German: "WIE VIELE MILJONEN GILT ALS EIN JURIDISHER PERSON?". In English, "HOW MANY MILLION MARKS DOES A JURIDICAL PERSON COST?". Using a pen, I quickly calculated the costs of the accommodation, catering, and meeting hall expenses. This was done according to the participant estimation he gave me. I calculated the sum being 3.5 Finnish Marks of that time. He thanked me for the information, and the meeting was over. The next day, I was informed from the KOP\* headquarters that 3,5 million Finnish Marks had been deposited as a security deposit. This money was used to cover the expenses of the following year's international journalist congress in Otaniemi. I think that was a sufficient amount of juridical person - the agreement was signed, and the congress was held.

\*Translator's remark: KOP stands for the bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki of that time, which later merged with another bank."
