# 138. My Farewell Party From Otaniemi In 1969

Now my rambling has progressed to the finish line. I should tell how I was defecated from Otaniemi in fall 1969 when I moved to orthodox and matter-of-fact, but still so dry as dust and business life service. The only incentive of businesses is to explore that thought by researching and thinking, one can produce increasingly more round metal washers, also called coins.

The teekkari-styled lifestyle colored my arrival at Teekkari Village on 1st May 1952. In that case, I must say that my departure must be called based on 17 years' experience non-conventional (cf. conventional).

It had been reserved one large hall in Dipoli, which had one coffee buffet table. The gentlemen of the Board of TKY led me there and then began:

\* To arrive in goose march in the whole staff of TKY and every one of them gave me a lovely fire red rose.
\* Then stepped out of the mind's movement and the rose bush's weight, I guess wobbling a bit, as a presentative of the customers' florist Vakkuri. The rosebush which he handed out to me was of order 300 to 400 roses. These initial ceremonies "could" somewhat be influenced by the fact that at the same time, a rose exhibition's remainings were being deconstructed, which had ended very recently.
\* I was then seated in a gorgeous leather armchair, which was told to be a thank from the staff for leaving. The first cup of coffee was poured that was not drunk because
\* the whole Castle Warden Host of the village rushed in with a stable mind and with the intention of stealing. They had RWBK as their background noisemaker, which I had heard somewhere before. The host had as an aid in their misdeed a stretcher, to which, by using necessary violence, I was thrown and then was roped.  However, misestimating my physical condition sprinkled the robbers on me yet another hundred roses "as a final greeting."
\* We went around the whole Ota-Onnela and arrived at Jämerä's Eye.
\* I then had to crawl on my own through the Eye after the host announced it was the only official route to leave the village. 
\* On the other side of the Eye, I was made a revealer of myself. Thankfully, only to my knees because I had to press the footprints of both my feet and hand to soft cement mortar. There those still seem to be with the signature.
\* After having endured all this, I finally got to the ambulance. It transported me with a prestigious entourage, including the police, to the memorable Rantasauna.

Whatever happened there by morning, I really can not reveal everything. However, one thing should be mentioned as a primitive beginning. After the first 145-degree löyly session, the party audience and I got permission from the host to reveal ourselves about the clothes. At one point in the celebration, the host made me swear an oath, which obliges me A) to keep the bald head and B) always participating in exchangesitsit. Also, I must be involved in Flora's Day ceremonies. Compliance with part A has so far not caused more significant problems, and part B, I've done as best as I could have done. In part B, have been police officers Aas and Katila have been as active support and security. 

So much for that Farewell Party. Dry, incisive teekkari fuss, huh?"
