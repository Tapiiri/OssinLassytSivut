# 151. The Teekkaris Filled My Apartment. My Name Is Michael Brown

When the staff's new residential building (now TKY I) was completed, I moved from TKY III C's dormitory to a "real company housing." It did not take much time when a group of the village's teekkaris decided under altruistic emotions to verify if my new apartment is spacious enough. And the volume is best found by filling the test space with a suitable substance. And they filled it with teekkaris. The flat consisted of five (5) rooms, a kitchen, a washroom, and a vestibule. All of it was filled in the full sense of the word. There were exactly as many teekkaris as there were, in fact, able to shove. Me, my wife, and my four puppies, as well as one adult Great Dane (Doora), were included due to circumstances to this "filler."

When the gridlock then erupted at the end of the experiment and the teekkaris, to my family's great relief, dissolved out the door, one foreign TKK student jerked me by the sleeve and said: "My name is Michael, but may I ask, "Why I am here?". Unfortunately, I really couldn't give him with my bad English language skills to give him a sensible explanation."
