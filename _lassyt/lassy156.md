# 156. BRAHNU And ZEMALIS As Researchers Of Radioactive Radiation

As early as the 1950s, the dangers of radioactivity were publicized. It was already then feared that nuclear power plants could cause potential damage to its surrounding environment. In one ESCAPADE, the teekkaris decided to release the willing from unnecessary radiation concerns as follows. A blue bus was borrowed from the city, driven at the J.K. Paasikivi's monument. A handsome text was put on the sides of the car: "FREE RADIATION EXAMINATION." Inside sat important-looking people in whitework jackets, Brahnu and Zemalis. They are the already mentioned Ethiopians who lived in Teekkari Village. They had as "research instruments" voltmeter and resistance meters borrowed from the University's Electrical Department. In the eyes of a layman, the instruments looked really scientific. To increase the credibility, result forms were printed. When the victim then stepped inside from the front door, another "professor" touched him with those instruments uttering super-magical numerical values and Ethiopian phrases. The subject then moved to the back of the wagon. Another "scientist," based on the obtained results, issued a radiation discharge statement and a result form, which he signed with distinguished style. Looking much relieved, the subjects left the place, depositing the important result form closely in their handbags. Almost a hundred people visited the car during the escapade day - who left the place with RADIATION of satisfaction. The majority were women and those over middle age.

Another thing came to my mind. When this architect student Brahnu, black and curly-haired, was training in Kuopio and in autumn, returned to Otaniemi. He had practiced a truly Savonian greeting: "NO MITTEEPÄ KUULUU?".\*
