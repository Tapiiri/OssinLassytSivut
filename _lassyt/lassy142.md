# 142. Littu ready for Teekkari Village's 50th anniversary in year 2002

As it is known from Latvia, when I was in Otaniemi, I started to practice chemistry by manufacturing every year a 30 liter-sized demisane full of LITTU (cf. round bottle = pytty\*, flat bottle = littu). Those littu bottles have been sent since Vappu 1975 in connection with the declaration of Vappu Rowdiness by the power of helium balloons, among other things, also into space. There is a more detailed description of these Vappulittus elsewhere in this book.

However, there is one littubottle, the existence of which and above all, the storage place is known only by a few and selected teekkaris. In connection with Castle Warden Host exchange ceremonies, the existence of the bottle is checked by following conscientiously following the regulations of the following charter of foundation: 

    ***CHARTER OF FOUNDATION***

    *After decades of hard work and relentless process and tasting experiment, to which countless teekkari generations have generously given their valuable expert help, I now consider having achieved in littu production to such achievements, that I can fairly enact following:*

    *As the 50th anniversary of Teekkari Village inevitably approaches, it is time to begin the preparations.*

    *Therefore, I have now decided to participate in this jubilee celebration by providing to both invitation guests and guests of honor littu, which I have made by myself.*

    *As collateral of my promise, I, therefore, hand over into the custody of Teekkari Village's Board and responsible supervision the following 2 (two) original littu bottles to be used in the aforementioned jubilee*

    *13.05.2002*


    *To prevent a sudden danger that can possibly come from the outside, I have considered it appropriate to cast a unique portland cement shell to protect the littu bottles.*

    *Let the littus be transported to the safest place in Teekkari Village, i.e., CONCLAVE, and let them be locked there to wait for the jubilee.*

    *Once a year, in connection with the Village exchange sitsit, let this text be read and let it be checked that the littus are intact and unopened. The new chairman of the Village Board and the present police authority shall certify with their signatures accompanying audit minutes that the inspection has been done. The following three (3) yo-yos are part of the 399 yo-yo's arsenal, which is the birthday present that I have received from Teekkari Village residents 2.4.1965. May these be handed over on 13.05.2002 as follows:*

    *To 1 representative of the government, to 1 representative of the city of Espoo, to 1 the youngest Teekkari Village resident that is present.*

    *The attached plastic bucket belongs de Jure to Teekkari Village, as it appeared on the door of my apartment 27.1.83 partially filled with water, and in it floated a bottle containing an invitation as a bottle post to exchange sitsit. The bottle returns as attached, and I used the water to make portland cement.*
