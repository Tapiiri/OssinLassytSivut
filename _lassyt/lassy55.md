# 55. Rantasauna's Alarm Devices And Teekkari Veisterä's Bachelor Party

Back in the days, I had to set up alarm devices also for the Rantasauna. However, not because of thieves but due to fire. Once that somewhat big stove was so hot that the actual steam vapor room caught fire. Thanks to the building's ceiling's thickness, the fire did not achieve flashpoint. The Espoo fire department, which quickly arrived at the scene, extinguished the fire quickly. To avoid the steam vapor room's overheating in the future, we installed a thermostat there. When the room was 145 °C warm, the thermostat set
a sizeable electric clock placed on the vestibule ceiling to ring. Thus, the people who socialized in the living room went to close the sauna stover's hatch. However, this system did its job but caused, at the same time, the birth of a new type of competition. In this competition, people did not leave the sauna benches until the bell started to ring. And when it rang, the benches indeed had that unbearable 145-degree heat. And did ring often, tells our well-known perennial sauna hostess, Mrs. Määttänen. "We Finns are sportspeople. We compete with anything. For example, with sauna steam vapor".

Teekkari Veisterä was at once going to get married. Depressed by this, his male friends ordered Rantasauna from Mrs. Määttänen. They wanted to give a hiding\* for one last time this turncoat. It was winter, and there was also snow on the ground. As Mrs. was warming up the sauna at dusk, a large truck arrived. The men demanded Määttänen sign the delivery. After receiving the signature, the men dropped to snow blanket a substantial wooden box. The outside of the box was full of foreign language text and odd serial numbers. As Määttäskä was stupefied, a couple of cars arrived on the scene "with the happiest mood." With crowbars and axes, they tore the box apart and lifted out of the box teekkari Veisterä, who was going to get married. The joyful shouts echoed. This modest Bolterabend had begun from TKY 5 so that he had been nailed to that box somewhere in Helsinki carrying four bottles of liquid substances. The parcel was transported to the train station. As freight to Pasila, the truck then brought it by a detour to Otaniemi. At the end of the trip, was the number of empty and full lunch bottles equal.

\*Translator's remark: the original word "löylyttää" means both 'give a hiding' and also 'provide steam vapors.'"
