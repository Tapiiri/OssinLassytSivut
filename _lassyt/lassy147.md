# 147. The UFO Idea Of The Century Went Wrong. ÄPY ÄINÄ ETC.

One spring, sometime in the village's early years, it was again AN ESCAPADE YEAR, and similists were working on the ÄPY magazine's publishing. At the same time, the whole world was full of those people who had seen UFOs. Especially quite often in daily newspapers, there were "eyewitness testimonies" of tourists that had come from outer space to stop by here on Earth. So we developed an unparalleled escapade jäynä that was meant to silence the whole world with its authenticity.

Our UFO-JÄYNÄ was as follows: somewhere in inner Finland along the evening in the twilight, there is a traveling bus. The bus is passing by an unoccupied forest area and goes up the hill. Both the driver and passengers see a plate-shaped, silvery object flashing strange lights at the hill. Both the driver and passengers are horrified. The thing rises into the air and disappears into the "blue of heaven." When the driver stops the bus and everyone rushes out, the UFO can be seen only as a small flashing point at altitudes. BUT at the ground, stranger things are going on. The terrain has burned completely almost for an acre of area. Strangely sour greenish smoke rises among charred pieces of wood and red-glowing stones. The illusion would have been perfect. The information of the world sensation would have rushed quickly around.

But the technical implementation of the jäynä with its transport, welding equipment, hydrogen balloon arsenal, special chemical effects, and other stuff would have come to pay at least 30,000 Finnish Marks. Therefore, it was decided that a sponsor is needed. This victim was chosen to be the APU magazine\*. The magazine would have received for the aforementioned reasonable compensation immortal reputation and the honor of the exclusive right to expose the scam when the topic was at its hottest. So, once again, we warmed our beloved Rantasauna and invited the then editor-in-chief Pauli Myllymäki from APU magazine to negotiate details.

Now the earlier mentioned magazine had as its year-round slogan "APU, AINA AIKAANSA EDELLÄ"\*\*. So now, these sponsorship negotiations with steam vapors, with Servi's Maija's great meals, and with more than reasonable chasers were coming to a positive conclusion. But, unfortunately, ÄPY-SIMILISTS started to roar into the mix in a choir their own advertising slogan: "ÄPY ÄINÄ ÄIKÄÄNSÄ ÄDÄLLÄ."

At first, also this advertising phrase greatly amused the editor-in-chief of APU magazine. However, the lavish serving of steam vapor, food, and drinks confused his judgment. Perhaps this was the reason why he suddenly interpreted the ÄPY slogan to degrade APU's venerable magazine. Despite our passionate argumentation to the contrary, Mr. Editor-in-Chie wore clothes on, put on his hat and cane, and left with dignity towards Helsinki. With him receded the sponsor money, and the whole idea was ruined.  What a sensation the world lost at the same time.

**Names of Servin Mökki cabinets:**

"It is useless to busy oneself" to come up with the names of Servin Mökki's cabinets. Maija herself has already a long time ago defined those in her own song's first verse: "HERRAT sinne ajaa hevosella ja JÄTKÄT saavat kävellä".\*

\*Translator's remark: APU is a Finnish family magazine.

\*\*Translator's remark: in English, "APU, AHEAD OF TIME."

\*\*\*Translator's remark: this is from the "Servin Maijan Mökki se seisoo" -song [Servi's Maija's Cottage It Stands] is less song these days in sitsit. "GENTLEMEN ride there with a horse, and WORKERS can walk." Literally translated, jätkä means "bloke," but it refers to a lower social class' male worker in this context."
