# 36. Bolterabend Teekkari's Foot Is Put In Plaster

Weddings are usually preceded by the last bachelor party organized by friends, in other words, auf Deutsch Bolterabend. Numerous of these were celebrated in Teekkari Village, both officially and unofficially. One night about at 03.00, my doorbell rang, and when I went wobbled to open the door, there was standing a cluster of teekkaris. Or, more likely, they were swaying. This cluster announced, "could mister leader now then come to inspect." When my weak objects did not lead to any result, I followed the set two dormitories lower. I was then living with my family in the upper cell of the C-horn. And in that party dormitory, there were indeed many things to be inspected. There the hero of the party, the bridegroom, lying on the table of the dormitory hall. He had given his everything, in words in Finnish, he had passed out. He was lying naked on a pure-white sheet.

On the other hand, the guests were dressed impeccably solemnly to the tailcoats with their academic decorations, except for the Bachelor of Medicine. He was wearing the appropriate white uniform. A large number of different products had also been borrowed from Helsinki Teurastamo\*. These items were stamps and stamp colors, which were used in slaughter animal inspections. The bridegroom was then inspected part by part by stamping the body with a relevant stamp to the body's relevant part. The stamp texts remind me of a stamp that has the following text: "1st class. Not fit to be eaten - only fit for feedstuff, etc." When the bridegroom was then inspected and stamped, the aforementioned Bachelor of Medicine came out. He had with him splint cardboard, gauze, and plaster. With expertise, he then splinted the lower limb of the bridegroom and left.

In the morning, the last act of this show came. When the bridegroom woke up and opened his blurry eyes, his friends stood around his bed, still dressed in black. When the bridegroom tried to get up, the friends prevented him by saying: "just be now absolutely calm and do not move at all." The friends stated that the bridegroom had run into women drunkenly and harassed them around the village and finally left bruised by a bus with the mentioned consequences. I followed from the top balcony of C how our bridegroom, supported by his bride, stumbled towards a bus and "towards a better future," foot plastered. After weddings, this couple then lived for years in Teekkari Village, obtained an heir. Probably that thigh wasn't painful too long.
