# 35. Midwife Congress

In the series "Meetings in Teekkari Village," it is definitely worth mentioning that the Nordic Congress of Midwives was held in Teekkari Village one summer. It happened so nicely that a teekkari's lady gave birth to a son at the Midwifery College during their congress. Another one gave birth at the Women's Clinic to a girl. I mentioned the chairman of the Midwifery Association of this teekkaris' tribute to their valuable work. As a result, the chairman immediately improvised two Nordic delegations to greet both mothers with their children. The educational film for this Midwife Congress was a French color movie, "Painless Childbirth." When there were no others in Otaniemi, I used the 16 mm projector in the Construction Department's auditorium. That is to say, me alone and the 400 midwives around me. When the movie was then shown, the auditorium's lights came on. Then the chairman, who was sitting in the front seat row, turned around. The chairman looked at me (I was behind in the auditorium) and said, "How come director Törrönen's nose has gone so white?". And I guess it must have gone. The film was a really matter-of-fact type. But the mother just kept smiling. During the congress, the stone statue\* equipped with a hole appeared in Teekkari Village. It is still there today. It is the secret society's first activity, "Cavemen." The midwives commented on the statue laconically: "it would be easy if we had that one."

\*Translator's remark: Ossi Törrönen refers probably to Jämerä's Eye statue close to Servin Mökki."
