# 12. Python Snake

Another animal in Otaniemi once received considerable publicity. A half-meter python snake. Teekkari Lompolo, by his author name Origo, lived in an apartment building in the so-called Retuperä area. I do not know where Origo had got his pet from, which roamed free in his Arava apartment\*. The regional supervisor's madam promised on request of Origo to clean the apartment. Her voice still shaking she told me that while washing the floor, she began to feel like someone was watching while Origo was in the next room. Then, turning her head, she let out a terrible scream and jumped on the table like a kangaroo. The aforementioned young snake had just come to the side to observe the principles of Finnish floor washing. After hearing the cry came Origo calmly to the room, lifted the snake into his hat over the coat rack, and found that he did not recall telling Mrs. Kortelainen about his pet. 

One way or another, the python once escaped and disappeared into the unknown. It did not receive much publicity until months later when a sports foundation janitor lifted a cast iron heating duct in the hall's basement. Mister python had cutely meandered over the heat pipe and politely raised his head from the well. To that courtesy, the janitor answered with a truehärmä horror scream, disappearing posthaste from the scene.

\*Translator's remark: Arava-apartment is a state supported apartment type."
