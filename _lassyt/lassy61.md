# 61. An Escapade At The Lappeenranta Brewery

The next Escapade reminds me of a trip to Lappeenranta. It was agreed with the Lappeenranta brewery's chief executive officer for the takeover operation of this brewery. Only he and we were aware of the matter and also the artillery of Lappeenranta, from which we received fire aid. So the factory staff was blissfully ignorant of anything. Suddenly, the cannons positioned around the factory then began their deafening blank cartridge concert. Simultaneously, we rushed to the factory area, throwing smoke bombs around us and shouting cheers. Our fighting spirit was stimulated meritoriously also by RWBK. Our attack was so compelling and surprising that after a brief resistance, the factory surrendered unconditionally. We plunged in ecstasy into the clubroom of the factory. We began to empty the bottle battery, which was collected there "by chance." When the joy was greatest, inside the clubroom came a modest gentleman. He remained at the doorway with a hand in his hand. When we asked about it, he said he had heard that the factory's owner had changed and asked for a job as a professional. He announced his profession being the CEO of the Lappeenranta Brewery. We quickly organized work to that very pleasant professional."
