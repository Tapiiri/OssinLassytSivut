# 76. Pekka Tarjanne's Wedding

When the blower of the Retuperä's most curved horn distinguished, teekkari Pekka Tarjanne, was about to get married, was RWBK naturally in corpore behind the Lauttasaari church\* waiting for the married couple to come out. I was there as a self-taught driver of the firetruck FORD T-28. When Pekka and his wife came out, we attacked them, lifted the wife next to the driver and Pekka on top of the stepladders, and the other Retuperä members filled the edge spots. The horns rang handsomely out when we chugged towards the photographer. However, the cargo was so heavy that our decent Suihku-Siwiä began to helplessly stall on an uphill slope. One by one, the guys jumped down with their horns and began to push. As the hill steepened, the whole bunch of the players pushed the car, and the last one to jump out was the bridegroom himself. So the car was pushed up the hill, and I was sitting at the steering wheel. Mrs. Tarjanne was in her wedding dress next to me,  the players were on both sides and bridegroom himself behind pushing, the tailcoat beveling the ground. The laughter and racket were really hard, as this "Rajamäki Regiment" proceeded towards the photo studio on top of the hill. And so we got there.

\*Translator's remark: Lauttasaari is a city district and also a big island in Helsinki. The Lauttasaari Church is located at Myllykallionrinne 1, Helsinki."
